# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists

Daily Reflections serves the recovery community by providing easy access to daily readings from Alcoholics Anonymous literature. The app makes it simple to:
1. Read the reflection for any day of the year
2. Engage with community discussion through comments
3. Find inspiration and support in recovery

## Problems It Solves

### Primary Problem
Traditional recovery literature is static and disconnected. People want to:

- Share thoughts and experiences
- Connect with others on the same journey

### User Needs

2. **Community**: Read and share experiences
3. **Archival Access**: Look up reflections from any date

   - Navigation to other dates

2. **Read and Reflect**
   - Clear typography for content
   - Quote and reference highlighted
   - Easy to digest in one screen

3. **Engage with Comments**
