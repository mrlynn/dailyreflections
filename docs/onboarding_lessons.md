### Key Design Principles
- **No Pressure**: Users can start, pause, and return at any time
- **Adaptive**: Content unlocks based on sobriety days, meeting attendance, and completed lessons
- **Integrated**: Introduces AA Companion features naturally within the learning path
- **Safe**: Acknowledges fear, confusion, and ambivalence as normal

## Module A: "You're Safe Here"

**Module Slug**: `youre-safe-here`
**Target**: Days 0-7 of sobriety
**Description**: Short, simple steps for your first days
**Gating**:
- Minimum sobriety days: 0
- Maximum sobriety days: None (removed to allow all users)
- Meeting attendance required: 0
- Prerequisites: None

### Overall Module Themes
- **Safety and Belonging**: "You're not alone anymore"
- **Gentle Introduction**: "You don't have to figure it all out today"
- **First Steps**: "Just show up and listen"

---

## Lesson 1: Welcome

**Lesson Slug**: `welcome`
**Subtitle**: you're not alone anymore
**Duration**: ~3 minutes
**Order**: 1

### Learning Objectives
1. Establish emotional safety and reduce anxiety
2. Set expectations for a non-judgmental, self-paced experience
3. Introduce the check-in pattern (emotional awareness)
4. Normalize feelings of confusion, fear, and uncertainty

### Content Summary

**Opening (Hero Block)**
- Heading: "we're glad you're here."
- Message: "whatever brought you here, this space is for you. many of us arrived scared, confused, or not sure if we belonged."

**Key Messages**
- You don't have to figure everything out today
- This path is made of small, simple steps
- You can take your own pace
- You can stop any time and come back any time

**Interactive Element**
- **Check-in question**: "how are you feeling right now?"
- **Scale options**: "overwhelmed", "scared", "numb", "hopeful"
- **Purpose**: Validate emotions, no right answers, just noticing

**Closing Message**
- "there are no right answers here. this isn't a test. it's just a way to notice where you are, one moment at a time."

### Illustration Recommendations

**Primary Illustration (Hero)**
- **Scene**: A soft, glowing lantern in a gentle, safe space (perhaps a cozy room or peaceful outdoor setting at dusk)
- **Mood**: Warm, welcoming, safe, non-threatening
- **Colors**: Soft oranges, warm yellows, gentle blues
- **Style**: Ghibli-inspired with rounded, organic shapes
- **Mascot variant**: "lantern-soft" - the lantern character should feel friendly and comforting, not intense or demanding
- **Visual metaphor**: A small light in the darkness, but not harsh - gentle and inviting
- **Details to include**:
  - Soft glow emanating from the lantern
  - Perhaps a path barely visible leading forward (very subtle, not forcing direction)
  - Comfortable, safe environment (cushions, soft textures, natural elements)

**Secondary Visual Elements**
- **Check-in interface**: Consider simple, non-clinical icons for the four emotional states (perhaps abstract shapes or gentle colors rather than faces)

## Lesson 2: What This Path Is (and Isn't)

**Lesson Slug**: `what-this-is`

**Duration**: ~4 minutes
**Order**: 2

### Learning Objectives
1. Set realistic expectations about what the app can and cannot do
2. Clarify the relationship to meetings, sponsors, and the Big Book
3. Reduce pressure and "should" thinking
4. Introduce the daily reflection feature as a gentle practice
5. Emphasize user autonomy and choice

### Content Summary

**Opening (Hero Block)**
- Heading: "this is a companion, not a set of rules."
- Message: "we'll show you patterns that helped many of us. you decide what to do with them."

**Key Messages**
- This path doesn't replace meetings, sponsors, or the Big Book
- It's here to help you find and use those things more easily
- Many newcomers couldn't absorb much at once - just needed to know they weren't crazy or alone
- You can move forward, pause, or come back later
- There's no "behind" here, just the next right step when you're ready

- **Title**: "see today's reflection"
- **Description**: "many of us like to start the day with a short reading. this feature shows you a fresh reflection each day."

### Illustration Recommendations

**Primary Illustration (Hero)**
- **Scene**: A companion walking alongside someone on a gentle path (not leading, not following, just alongside)
- **Mood**: Partnership, guidance without pressure, collaborative
- **Colors**: Balanced palette - perhaps morning colors (soft pinks, gentle yellows, calm blues)
- **Style**: Ghibli-inspired showing movement and journey
- **Mascot variant**: "path" - the lantern might be walking/floating beside a person, or illuminating choices rather than dictating direction
- **Visual metaphor**: The path has multiple directions available, none marked as "wrong"
- **Details to include**:
  - Path that branches or has options visible
  - Lantern providing light but not forcing a specific direction
  - Perhaps hints of other tools/resources in the background (representing meetings, sponsors, Big Book) that are visible but not demanding attention
  - Sense of companionship and support

**Secondary Visual Elements**
- **Quote visual**: Consider a simple, elegant quote presentation - perhaps with a subtle background that suggests community (abstract figures or warm ambient lighting)

### Content Summary

### Illustration Recommendations

**Primary Illustration (Hero)**
- **Scene**: A view of people gathering (abstract/simplified) in a welcoming space - perhaps seen from outside looking in, or from a doorway perspective
- **Mood**: Welcoming, not intimidating, showing that "just listening" is enough
- **Colors**: Warm, inviting tones - evening/indoor lighting
- **Style**: Ghibli-inspired with focus on safe, communal space

- **Details to include**:
  - A sense of community inside without showing specific faces or details (abstract/blurred figures to maintain privacy and reduce intimidation)
  - A comfortable distance - viewer is at the threshold, not forced into the center
  - Warm light coming from inside the space
  - The lantern companion nearby, supportive but not pushy

**Secondary Visual Elements**
- **Meeting Finder interface**: Clean, simple, non-overwhelming

## Illustration Style Guide

### Overall Visual Direction

**Ghibli-Inspired Elements**:
- Organic, flowing shapes
- Warm, inviting color palettes
- Attention to small, comforting details
- Sense of magic in everyday moments
- Characters/mascot with personality but not cutesy
- Natural elements (light, plants, simple landscapes)
- Emphasis on mood and atmosphere over detail

**Lantern/Light Metaphor**:
- The mascot is a gentle lantern character
- Provides light without being harsh or demanding
- Companion on the journey, not a leader or commander
- Different "variants" for different emotional contexts:
  - **lantern-soft**: Warm, comforting, safe
  - **path**: Illuminating options, showing the way
  - **companion**: Walking alongside, supportive

**Color Palette Suggestions**:
- **Primary**: Warm yellows, soft oranges (lantern glow)
- **Supporting**: Gentle blues and teals (calm, safe)
- **Accents**: Soft pinks (hope), muted greens (growth)
- **Backgrounds**: Deep blues for night, warm neutrals for indoor spaces
- **Avoid**: Harsh reds, clinical whites, anything that feels aggressive or demanding

**Emotional Tone**:
- Safe and welcoming, never intimidating
- Hopeful but realistic, not toxic positivity
- Gentle and soft, not harsh or demanding
- Intimate and personal, not corporate or clinical
- Warm and human, acknowledging difficulty while offering comfort

### Technical Considerations

**Format**: SVG preferred for web scalability
**Responsive**: Illustrations should work at multiple sizes
**Accessibility**: Ensure sufficient contrast for readability
**File size**: Optimize for web performance
**Animation**: Consider subtle animations (gentle glow, soft movement) for hero blocks
