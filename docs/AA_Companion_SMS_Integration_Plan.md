# 📱 AA Companion – SMS Messaging Integration Plan

### **Purpose**
Integrate SMS messaging to make **AA Companion** more engaging and supportive through personalized communication. SMS will deliver **daily reflections, reminders, and optional sharing** — helping users stay connected to their recovery journey, even when they’re not in the app.

## **1. Product Goals**

**Primary Use Cases**
1. **Daily Reflection Delivery**  
   - Automatic 7–8am local time text: “Today’s Reflection” (title + excerpt + link)
2. **Reminders**  
   - Nightly Step 10 Journal prompt (e.g., 9pm local)  
   - Weekly Step 4 check-ins  
   - Optional meeting reminders
3. **Share by SMS**  
   - From any reflection or post: “Text this to me” or “Share via SMS”  
   - Self-only by default; sending to others requires explicit opt-in
4. **Two-Way SMS (Optional)**  
   - Reply `DONE` → logs journal completion  
   - Reply `TODAY` → receive current reflection  
   - Always support `STOP`, `START`, and `HELP`

**Key Principles**
- Respect **anonymity and safety** — no personal details or PHI in messages.  
- Explicit **opt-in** and easy **opt-out (STOP)**.  
- Default **quiet hours (9pm–7am)**.  
- Scalable, compliant, and consistent with the app’s recovery tone.
