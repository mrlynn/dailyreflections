## Implementation Options

### Option 1: Use Existing Module A Images as Placeholders
Until custom images are created, reuse Module A images:
- lesson1.jpg → use orientation/lesson2.jpg (path theme)
- lesson2.jpg → use orientation/lesson1.jpg (welcoming, internal)
- lesson3.jpg → use orientation/lesson3.jpg (meeting/doorway theme)
- lesson4.jpg → use orientation/lesson2.jpg (path/journey theme)

### Option 2: Commission New Illustrations
Work with an illustrator to create the 4 images above in the established style.

### Option 3: Use Generic Placeholders
Solid color backgrounds with CSS gradients until images are ready.

## Recommendation

**For initial testing:** Use Option 1 (reuse existing images)
- Images will still be beautiful and thematically appropriate
- Lessons are self-explanatory so image mismatches won't confuse users
- Allows immediate deployment and testing

**For production:** Create Option 2 (custom illustrations)
- Each lesson's image should uniquely support its message
- Investment in visual identity pays off in user engagement
- Estimated time: 1-2 weeks with an illustrator
