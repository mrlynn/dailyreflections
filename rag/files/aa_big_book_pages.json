To show other alcoholics PRECISELY HOW WE\nHAVE RECOVERED is the main purpose of this book. For them, we\nhope these pages will prove so convincing that no further authentica-\ntion will be necessary. We think this account of our experiences will\nhelp everyone to better understand the alcoholic. Many do not compre-\nhend that the alcoholic is a very sick person. And besides, we are sure\nthat our way of living has its advan- tages for all.\nIt is important that we remain anonymous because we are too few,\nat present, to handle the overwhelming number of personal appeals\nwhich may result from this publication. Being mostly business or\nprofessional folk we could not well carry on our occupations in such\nan event. We would like it understood that our alcoholic work is an\navocation.\nWhen writing or speaking publicly about alcoholism, we urge each\nof our Fellowship to omit his personal name, designating himself\ninstead as ”A member of Alcoholics Anonymous.“\nVery earnestly we ask the press also, to observe this request, for\notherwise we shall be greatly handicapped.\nWe are not an organization in the conventional sense of the word.\nThere are no fees nor dues whatsoever. The only requirement for\nmembership is an honest de- sire to stop drinking. We are not allied\nwith any par- ticular faith, sect or denomination, nor do we oppose\nanyone. We simply wish to be helpful to those who are afflicted.\nWe shall be interested to hear from those who are getting results\nfrom this book, particularly from those who have commenced work\nwith other alcoholics. We should like to be helpful to such cases.\nInquiry by scientific, medical, and religious societies will be wel-\ncomed. (AA BBSG, P.O.

    "text": "1\nTHE DOCTOR’S OPINION\nW\nE OF Alcoholics Anonymous believe that the reader will be interested\nin the medical estimate of the plan of recovery described in this book.\nConvincing testimony must surely come from medical men who have had ex-\nperience with the sufferings of our members and have witnessed our return to\nhealth. A well known doctor, chief physician at a nationally prominent hospi-\ntal specializing in alcoholic and drug addiction, gave Alcoholics Anonymous\nthis letter:\nTo Whom It May Concern:\nI have specialized in the treatment of alcoholism for many years.\nAbout four years ago I attended a patient who, though he had been a\ncompetent business man of good earning capacity, was an alcoholic of a\ntype I had come to regard as hopeless.\nIn the course of his third treatment he acquired certain ideas concerning a\npossible means of recovery. As part of his rehabilitation he commenced to\npresent his conceptions to other alcoholics, impressing upon them that they\nmust do likewise with still others. This has become the basis of a rapidly\ngrowing fellowship of these men and their families. This man and over one\nhundred others appear to have recovered.\nI personally know thirty of these cases who were of the type with whom\nother methods had failed completely.\n2 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nThese facts appear to be of extreme medical importance; because of the\nextraordinary possibilities of rapid growth inherent in this group they may\nmark a new epoch in the annals of alcoholism. These men may well have a\nremedy for thousands of such situations.\nYou may rely absolutely on anything they say about themselves.\nVery truly yours,\n(Signed) - - - - - M.D.\nThe physician who, at our request, gave us this letter, has been kind enough\nto enlarge upon his views in another statement which follows. In this state-\nment he confirms what we who have suffered alcoholic torture must believe\nthat the body of the alcoholic is quite as abnormal as his mind. It did not sat-\nisfy us to be told that we could not control our drinking just because we were\nmaladjusted to life, that we were in full flight from reality, or were outright\nmental defectives. These things were true to some extent, in fact, to a consider-\nable extent with some of us. But we are sure that our bodies were sickened as\nwell. In our belief, any picture of the alcoholic which leaves out this physical\nfactor is incomplete.\nThe doctor’s theory that we have an allergy to alcohol interests us. As lay-\nmen, our opinion as to its soundness may, of course, mean little. But as ex-\nalcoholics, we can say that his explanation makes good sense. It explains many\nthings for which we cannot otherwise account.\nThough we work out our solution on the spiritual as well as an altruistic\nplane, we favor hospitalization for\n4",

More often than not, it is impera-\ntive that a man’s brain be cleared before he is approached, as he has then a\nbetter chance of understanding and accepting what we have to offer.\nThe doctor writes:\nThe subject presented in this book seems to me to be of paramount\nimportance to those afflicted with alcoholic addiction.\nI say this after many years’ experience as Medical Director of one of the\noldest hospitals in the country treating alcoholic and drug addiction.\nThere was, therefore, a sense of real satisfaction when I was asked to\ncontribute a few words on a subject which is covered in such masterly detail\nin these pages.\nWe doctors have realized for a long time that some form of moral\npsychology was of urgent importance to alcoholics, but its application\npresented difficulties beyond our conception. What with our ultra-modern\nstandards, our scientific approach to everything, we are perhaps not well\nequipped to apply the powers of good that lie outside our synthetic knowledge.\nAbout four years ago one of the leading contributors to this book came\nunder our care in this hospital and while here he acquired some ideas which\nhe put into practical application at once.\nLater, he requested the privilege of being allowed to tell his story to other\npatients here and with some misgiving, we consented. The cases we have\nfollowed through have been most interesting; in fact, many of them are\namazing. The unselfishness of these men\n4 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nas we have come to know them, the entire absence of profit motive, and their\ncommunity spirit, is indeed inspiring to one who has labored long and wearily\nin this alcoholic field. They believe in themselves, and still more in the Po-\nwer which pulls chronic alcoholics back from the gates of death.\nOf course an alcoholic ought to be freed from his physical craving for\nliquor, and this often requires a definite hospital procedure, before psycho-\nlogical measures can be of maximum benefit.\nWe believe, and so suggested a few years ago, that the action of alcohol on\nthese chronic alcoholics is a manifestation of an allergy; that the phenomenon\nof craving is limited to this class and never occurs in the average temperate\ndrinker. These allergic types can never safely use alcohol in any form at all;\nand once having formed the habit and found they cannot break it, once having\nlost their selfconfidence, their reliance upon things human, their problems\npile up on them and become astonishingly difficult to solve. Frothy emotio-\nnal appeal seldom suffices. The message which can interest and hold these\nalcoholic people must have depth and weight. In nearly all cases, their ideals\nmust be grounded in a power greater than themselves, if they are to recreate\ntheir lives.\nIf any feel that as psychiatrists directing a hospital for alcoholics we appear\nsomewhat sentimental, let them stand with us a while on the firing line, see\nthe tragedies, the despairing wives, the little children; let the solving of these\nproblems become a part of their daily work, and even of their sleeping\nmoments, and the most cyni-\n5",

The sensation is so elusive that, while they admit it is injurious,\nthey cannot after a time differentiate the true from the false. To them, their\nalcoholic life seems the only normal one. They are restless, irritable and\ndiscontented, unless they can again experience the sense of ease and comfort\nwhich comes at once by taking a few drinks—drinks which they see others\ntaking with impunity. After they have succumbed to the desire again, as so\nmany do, and the phenomenon of craving develops, they pass through the\nwell-known stages of a spree, emerging remorseful, with a firm resolution\nnot to drink again. This is repeated over and over, and unless this person can\nexperience an entire psychic change there is very little hope of his recovery.\nOn the other hand—and strange as this may seem to those who do not\nunderstand—once a psychic change has occurred, the very same person who\nseemed doomed, who had so many problems he despaired of ever solving\nthem, suddenly finds himself easily able to control his desire for alcohol, the\nonly effort necessary being that required to follow a few simple rules.\nMen have cried out to me in sincere and despairing appeal: ”Doctor, I\ncannot go on like this! I have ev-\n6 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nerything to live for! I must stop, but I cannot! You must help me!“\nFaced with this problem, if a doctor is honest with himself, he must\nsometimes feel his own inadequacy. Although he gives all that is in him, it\noften is not enough. One feels that something more than human power is\nneeded to produce the essential psychic change. Though the aggregate of\nrecoveries resulting from psychiatric effort is considerable, we physicians\nmust admit we have made little impression upon the problem as a whole.\nMany types do not respond to the ordinary psychological approach.\nI do not hold with those who believe that alcoholism is entirely a problem\nof mental control. I have had many men who had, for example, worked a\nperiod of months on some problem or business deal which was to be settled\non a certain date, favorably to them. They took a drink a day or so prior to\nthe date, and then the phenomenon of craving at once became paramount to\nall other interests so that the important appointment was not met. These men\nwere not drinking to escape; they were drinking to overcome a craving beyond\ntheir mental control.\nThere are many situations which arise out of the phenomenon of craving\nwhich cause men to make the supreme sacrifice rather than continue to fight.\nThe classification of alcoholics seems most difficult, and in much detail is\noutside the scope of this book. There are, of course, the psychopaths who are\nemotionally unstable. We are all familiar with this type. They are always\n”going on the wagon for keeps.“\n6",

He plans various ways of drinking. He changes his brand or his\nenvironment. There is the type who always believes that after being entirely\nfree from alcohol for a period of time he can take a drink without danger.\nThere is the manic-depressive type, who is, perhaps, the least understood by\nhis friends, and about whom a whole chapter could be written.\nThen there are types entirely normal in every respect except in the effect\nalcohol has upon them. They are often able, intelligent, friendly people.\nAll these, and many others, have one symptom in common: they cannot\nstart drinking without developing the phenomenon of craving. This\nphenomenon, as we have suggested, may be the manifestation of an allergy\nwhich differentiates these people, and sets them apart as a distinct entity. It\nhas never been, by any treatment with which we are familiar, permanently\neradicated. The only relief we have to suggest is entire abstinence.\nThis immediately precipitates us into a seething caldron of debate. Much\nhas been written pro and con, but among physicians, the general opinion\nseems to be that most chronic alcoholics are doomed.\nWhat is the solutions Perhaps I can best answer this by relating an\nexperience of two years ago.\nAbout one year prior to this experience a man was brought in to be treated\nfor chronic alcoholism. He had\n8 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nbut partially recovered from a gastric hemorrhage and seemed to be a case of\npathological mental deterioration. He had lost everything worth while in life\nand was only living, one might say, to drink. He frankly admitted and believed\nthat for him there was no hope. Following the elimination of alcohol there\nwas found to be no permanent brain injury. He accepted the plan outlined in\nthis book. One year later he called to see me, and I experienced a very strange\nsensation. I knew the man by name, and partly recognized his features, but\nthere all resemblance ended. From a trembling, despairing, nervous wreck,\nhad emerged a man brimming over with self-reliance and contentment. I\ntalked with him for some time, but was not able to bring myself to feel that I\nhad known him before. To me he was a stranger, and so he left me. More\nthan three years have now passed with no return to alcohol.\nWhen I need a mental uplift, I often think of another case brought in by a\nphysician prominent in New York City. The patient had made his own\ndiagnosis, and deciding his situation hopeless, had hidden in a deserted barn\ndetermined to die. He was rescued by a searching party, and, in desperate\ncondition, brought to me. Following his physical rehabilitation, he had a talk\nwith me in which he frankly stated he thought the treatment a waste of effort,\nunless I could assure him, which no one ever had, that in the future he would\nhave the ”will power“ to resist the impulse to drink.\nHis alcoholic problem was so complex, and his depression so great, that\nwe felt his only hope would be\n7",

He\nhas not had a drink for more than three years. I see him now and then and he\nis as fine a specimen of manhood as one could wish to meet.\nI earnestly advise every alcoholic to read this book through, and\nthough perhaps he came to scoff, he may remain to pray.\nChapter One 10\nBILL’S STORY\nW\nAR fever ran high in the New England town to which we new, young\nofficers from Plattsburg were assigned, and we were flattered when the\nfirst citizens took us to their homes, making us feel heroic. Here was love,\napplause, war; moments sublime with intervals hilarious. I was part of life at\nlast, and in the midst of the excitement I discovered liquor. I forgot the strong\nwarnings and the prejudices of my people concerning drink. In time we sailed\nfor ”Over There.“ I was very lonely and again turned to alcohol.\nWe landed in England. I visited Winchester Cathedral. Much moved, I wan-\ndered outside. My attention was caught by a doggerel on an old tombstone:\n”Here lies a Hampshire Grenadier\nWho caught his death\nDrinking cold small beer.\nA good soldier is ne’er forgot Whether he dieth by musket\nOr by pot.“\nOminous warning—which I failed to heed.\nTwenty-two, and a veteran of foreign wars, I went home at last.

My talent for leadership, I imagined, would\nBILL’S STORY 11\nplace me at the head of vast enterprises which I would manage with utmost\nassurance.\nI took a night law course, and obtained employment as investigator for a\nsurety company. The drive for success was on. I’d prove to the world I was\nimportant. My work took me about Wall Street and little by little I became\ninterested in the market. Many people lost money—but some became very\nrich. Why not I? I studied economics and business as well as law. Potential\nalcoholic that I was, I nearly failed my law course. At one of the finals I was\ntoo drunk to think or write. Though my drinking was not yet continuous, it\ndisturbed my wife. We had long talks when I would still her forebodings by\ntelling her that men of genius conceived their best projects when drunk; that\nthe most majestic constructions of philosophic thought were so derived.\nBy the time I had completed the course, I knew the law was not for me.

Our friends thought a lunacy commission should\nbe appointed. Perhaps they were right. I had had some success at speculation,\nso we had a little money, but we once worked on a farm for a month to avoid\ndrawing on our small capital. That was the last honest manual labor on my part\nfor many a day. We covered the whole eastern United States in a year.

Scoffers could scoff and be damned. I made a host of fair-weather friends.\nMy drinking assumed more serious proportions, continuing all day and al-\nmost every night. The remonstrances of my friends terminated in a row and I\nbecame a lone wolf. There were many unhappy scenes in our sumptuous apart-\nment. There had been no real infidelity, for loyalty to my wife, helped at times\nby extreme drunkenness, kept me out of those scrapes.\nBILL’S STORY 13\nIn 1929 I contracted golf fever. We went at once to the country, my wife to\napplaud while I started out to overtake Walter Hagen. Liquor caught up with\nme much faster than I came up behind Walter. I began to be jittery in the morn-\ning. Golf permitted drinking every day and every night. It was fun to carom\naround the exclusive course which had inspired such awe in me as a lad.

I found a job; then lost it as the\nresult of a brawl with a taxi driver. Mercifully, no one could guess that I was to\nhave no real employment for five years, or hardly draw a sober breath. My\nwife began to work in a department store, coming home exhausted to find me\ndrunk. I became an unwelcome hanger-on at brokerage places.\nLiquor ceased to be a luxury; it became a necessity. ”Bathtub“ gin, two bot-\ntles a day, and often three, got to be routine. Sometimes a small deal would net\na few hundred dollars, and I would pay my bills at the bars and delicatessens.\nThis went on endlessly, and I began to waken very early in the morning shak-\ning violently. A tumbler full of gin followed by half a dozen bottles of beer\nwould be required if I were to eat any breakfast. Nevertheless, I still thought I\ncould control the situation, and there were periods of sobriety which renewed\nmy wife’s hope.\nGradually things got worse. The house was taken over by the mortgage holder,\nmy mother-in-law died, my wife and fatherin-law became ill.\nThen I got a promising business opportunity.

Before then, I had written lots of sweet promises,\nbut my wife happily observed that this time I meant business. And so I did.\nBILL’S STORY 15\nShortly afterward I came home drunk. There had been no fight. Where had\nbeen my high resolve? I simply didn’t know. It hadn’t even come to mind.\nSomeone had pushed a drink my way, and I had taken it. Was I crazy? I began\nto wonder, for such an appalling lack of perspective seemed near being just\nthat.\nRenewing my resolve, I tried again. Some time passed, and confidence be-\ngan to be replaced by cock-sureness. I could laugh at the gin mills. Now I had\nwhat it takes! One day I walked into a cafe to telephone. In no time I was\nbeating on the bar asking myself how it happened. As the whiskey rose to my\nhead I told myself I would manage better next time, but I might as well get\ngood and drunk then. And I did.\nThe remorse, horror and hopelessness of the next morning are unforgettable.\nThe courage to do battle was not there. My brain raced uncontrollably and\nthere was a terrible sense of impending calamity. I hardly dared cross the street,\nlest I collapse and be run down by an early morning truck, for it was scarcely\ndaylight. An all night place supplied me with a dozen glasses of ale. My writh-\ning nerves were stilled at last. A morning paper told me the market had gone to\nhell again. Well, so had I. The market would recover, but I wouldn’t. That was\na hard thought. Should I kill myself? No-not now. Then a mental fog settled\ndown. Gin would fix that.

Then came the night when the physical and mental torture was\nso hellish I feared I would burst through my window, sash and all. Somehow I\nmanaged to drag my mattress to a lower floor, lest I suddenly leap. A doctor\ncame with a heavy sedative. Next day found me drinking both gin and seda-\ntive.

The curve\nof my declining moral and bodily health fell off like a ski-jump. After a time I\nreturned to the hospital. This was the finish, the curtain, it seemed to me. My\nweary and despairing wife was informed that it would all end with heart fail-\nure during delirium tremens, or I would develop a wet brain, perhaps within a\nyear. She would soon have to give me over to the undertaker or the asylum.\nThey did not need to tell me. I knew, and almost welcomed the idea. It was a\ndevastating blow to my pride. I, who had thought so well of myself and my\nabilities, of my capacity to surmount obstacles, was cornered at last. Now I\nwas to plunge into the dark, joining that endless procession of sots who had\ngone on before. I thought of my poor wife. There had been much happiness\nafter all.

Quicksand stretched around me in all directions. I had met my\nmatch. I had been overwhelmed. Alcohol was my master.\nTrembling, I stepped from the hospital a broken man. Fear sobered me for a\nbit. Then came the insidious insanity of that first drink, and on Armistice Day\n1934, I was off again. Everyone became resigned to the certainty that I would\nhave to be shut up somewhere, or would stumble along to a miserable end.\nHow dark it is before the dawn! In reality that was the beginning of my last\ndebauch. I was soon to be catapulted into\n18 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nwhat I like to call the fourth dimension of existence.

It will not take\nlong for you to decide, if you are honest with yourself about it. It may be worth\na bad case of jitters if you get a full knowledge of your condition.\nThough there is no way of proving it, we believe that early in our drinking\ncareers most of us could have stopped drinking. But the difficulty is that few\nalcoholics have enough desire to stop while there is yet time. We have heard of\na few instances where people, who showed definite signs of alcoholism, were\nable to stop for a long period because of an overpowering desire to do so. Here\nis one.\nA man of thirty was doing a great deal of spree drinking. He was very nerv-\nous in the morning after these bouts and quieted himself with more liquor. He\nwas ambitious to succeed in business, but saw that he would get nowhere if he\ndrank at all. Once he started, he had no control whatever. He made up his mind\nthat until he had been successful in business and had retired, he would not\ntouch another drop. An exceptional man, he remained bone dry for twenty-five\nyears, and retired at the age of fifty-five, after a successful and happy business\ncareer. Then he fell victim to a belief which practically every alcoholic has—\nthat his long period of sobriety and self-discipline had qualified him to drink\nas other men. Out came his carpet slippers and a bottle. In two months he was\nin a hospital, puzzled and humili-\n44 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nated. He tried to regulate his drinking for a while, making several trips to the\nhospital meantime. Then, gathering all his forces, he attempted to stop alto-\ngether and found he could not. Every means of solving his problem which\nmoney could buy was at his disposal. Every attempt failed. Though a robust\nman at retirement, he went to pieces quickly, and was dead within four years.\nThis case contains a powerful lesson. Most of us have believed that if we\nremained sober for a long stretch, we could thereafter drink normally. But here\nis a man who at fifty-five years found he was just where he had left off at thirty.\nWe have seen the truth demonstrated again and again: ”once an alcoholic, al-\nways an alcoholic.“ Commencing to drink after a period of sobriety, we are in\na short time as bad as ever. If we are planning to stop drinking, there must be\nno reservation of any kind, nor any lurking notion that someday we will be\nimmune to alcohol.\n23",

His family was re-assembled, and he began to work as a\nsalesman for the business he had lost through drinking.

We asked him to tell us exactly how it happened.\nThis is his story: ”I came to work on Tuesday morning. I remember I felt\nirritated that I had to be a salesman for a concern I once owned. I had a few\nwords with the boss, but nothing serious. Then I decided to drive into the country\nand see one of my prospects for a car. On the way I felt hungry so I stopped at\na roadside place where they have a bar. I had no intention of drinking. I just\nthought I would get a sandwich. I also had the notion that I might find a cus-\ntomer for a car at this place, which was familiar, for I had been going to it for\nyears. I had eaten there many times during the months I was sober. I sat down\nat a table and ordered a sandwich and a glass of milk. Still no thought of drink-\ning. I ordered another sandwich and decided to have another glass of milk.\n”Suddenly the thought crossed my mind that if I were to put an ounce of\nwhiskey in my milk, it couldn’t hurt me on a full stomach. I ordered a whiskey\nand poured it into the milk. ù I vaguely sensed I was not being any too smart,\nbut felt reassured, as I was taking the whiskey on a full stomach. The experi-\nment went so well that I ordered another whiskey and poured it into more\nmilk. That didn’t seem to bother me so I tried another.“\n48 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nThus started one more journey to the asylum for Jim. Here was the threat of\ncommitment, the loss of family and position, to say nothing of that intense\nmental and physical suffering which drinking always caused him. He had much\nknowledge about himself as an alcoholic. Yet all reasons for not drinking were\neasily pushed aside in favor of the foolish idea be could take whiskey if only\nhe mixed it with milk!\nWhatever the precise definition of the word may be, we call this plain insan-\nity. How can such a lack of proportion, of the ability to think straight, be called\nanything else?\nYou may think this an extreme case. To us it is not farfetched, for this kind of\nthinking has been characteristic of every single one of us. We have sometimes\nreflected more than Jim did upon the consequences. But there was always the\ncurious mental phenomenon, that parallel with our sound reasoning there in-\nevitably ran some insanely trivial excuse for taking the first drink.

This time I had not thought of the consequences at all.\nI had commenced to drink as carelessly as though the cocktails were ginger\nale. I now remembered what my alcoholic friends had told me, how they proph-\nesied that if I had an alcoholic mind, the time and place would come—I would\ndrink again.

I knew then. It was a crushing blow. ”Two of the members of\nAlcoholics Anonymous came to see me. They grinned, which I didn’t like so\nmuch, and then asked me if I thought myself alcoholic and if I were really\nlicked this time. I had to concede both propositions. They piled on me heaps of\nevidence to the effect that an alcoholic mentality, such as I had exhibited in\nWashington, was a hopeless condition. They cited cases out of their own expe-\nrience by the dozen. This process snuffed out the last flicker of conviction that\nI could do the job myself.\n54 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\n”Then they outlined the spiritual answer and program of action which a hun-\ndred of them had followed successfully. Though I had been only a nominal\nchurchman, their proposals were not, intellectually, hard to swallow. But the\nprogram of action, though entirely sensible, was pretty drastic. It meant I would\nhave to throw several lifelong conceptions out of the window. That was not\neasy. But the moment I made up my mind to go through with the process, I had\nthe curious feeling that my alcoholic condition was relieved, as in fact it proved\nto be.\n”Quite as important was the discovery that spiritual principles would solve\nall my problems. I have since been brought into a way of living infinitely more\nsatisfying and, I hope, more useful than the life I lived before.

Our\nexperience shows that you need not be disconcerted.\nWE AGNOSTICS 57\nIf a mere code of morals, or a better philosophy of life were sufficient to\novercome alcoholism, many of us would have recovered long ago. But we\nfound that such codes and philosophies did not save us, no matter how much\nwe tried. We could wish to be moral, we could wish to be philosophically\ncomforted, in fact, we could will these things with all our might, but the needed\npower wasn’t there. Our human resources, as marshalled by the will, were not\nsufficient; they failed utterly.\nLack of power, that was our dilemma. We had to find a power by which we\ncould live, and it had to be A Power Greater Than Ourselves. Obviously. But\nwhere and how were we to find this Power?\nWell, that’s exactly what this book is about. Its main object is to enable you\nto find a Power greater than yourself, which will solve your problem. That\nmeans we have written a book which we believe to be spiritual as well as\nmoral. And it means, of course, that we are going to talk about God. Here\ndifficulty arises with agnostics.

It has been repeatedly proven among us that\nupon this simple cornerstone a wonderfully effective spiritual structure can be\nbuilt. That was great news to us, for we had assumed we could not make use of\nspiritual principles unless we accepted many things on faith which seemed\ndifficult to believe. When people presented us with spiritual approaches, how\nfrequently did we all say: ”I wish I had what that man has.

This sort of thinking had to be abandoned.\nThough some of us resisted, we found no great difficulty in casting aside such\nfeelings. Faced with alcoholic destruction, we soon became as open minded\non spiritual matters as we had tried to be on other questions. In this respect\nalcohol was a great persuader. It finally beat us into a state of reasonableness.\nSometimes this was a tedious process; we hope no one will be prejudiced as\nlong as some of us were.\nThe reader may still ask why he should believe in a Power greater than him-\nself. We think there are good reasons. Let us have a look at some of them.\nThe practical individual of today is a stickler for facts and results. Neverthe-\nless, the twentieth century readily accepts theories of all kinds, provided they\nare firmly grounded in fact. We have numerous theories, for example, about\nelectricity. Everybody believes them without a murmur of doubt. Why this\nready acceptance? Simply because it is impossible to explain what we see,\nfeel, direct, and use, without a reasonable assumption as a starting point. Eve-\nrybody nowadays, believes in scores of assump-\nWE AGNOSTICS 61\ntions for which there is good evidence, but no perfect visual proof. And does\nnot science demonstrate that visual proof is the weakest proof? It is being\nconstantly revealed, as mankind studies the material world, that outward ap-\npearances are not inward reality at all. To illustrate: The prosaic steel girder is\na mass of electrons whirling around each other at incredible speed. These tiny\nbodies are governed by precise laws, and these laws hold true throughout the\nmaterial world. Science tells us so. We have no reason to doubt it. When, how-\never, the perfectly logical assumption is suggested that underneath the mate-\nrial world and life as we see it, there is an All Powerful, Guiding, Creative\nIntelligence, right there our perverse streak comes to the surface and we labo-\nriously set out to convince ourselves it isn’t so. We read wordy books and\nindulge in windy arguments, thinking we believe this universe needs no God\nto explain it. Were our contentions true, it would follow that life originated out\nof nothing, means nothing, and proceeds nowhere.\nInstead of regarding ourselves as intelligent agents, spearheads of God’s\never advancing Creation, we agnostics and atheists chose to believe that our\nhuman intelligence was the last word, the alpha and the omega, the beginning\nand end of all. Rather vain of us, wasn’t it?\nWe, who have traveled this dubious path, beg you to lay aside prejudice,\neven against organized religion. We have learned that whatever the human\nfrailties of various faiths may be, those faiths have given purpose and direction\nto millions. People of faith have a logical idea\n62 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nof what life is all about. Actually, we used to have no reasonable conception\nwhatever. We used to amuse ourselves by cynically dissecting spiritual beliefs\nand practices when we might have observed that many spiritually-minded per-\nsons of all races, colors, and creeds were demonstrating a degree of stability,\nhappiness and usefulness which we should have sought ourselves.\n31",

We never gave the spiritual side of life a fair hearing.\nIn our personal stories you will find wide variation in the way each teller\napproaches and conceives of the Power which is greater than himself.

This Power has in each case accomplished the miraculous, the hu-\nmanly impossible.

Post-war disillusionment, ever more serious alco-\nholism, impending mental and physical collapse, brought him to the point of\nself-destruction.\nOne night, when confined in a hospital, he was approached by an alcoholic\nwho had known a spiritual experience. Our friend’s gorge rose as he bitterly\ncried out: ”If there is a God, He certainly hasn’t done anything for me.“ But\nlater, alone in his room, he asked himself this question: ”Is it possible that all\nthe religious people I have known are wrong?“ While pondering the answer he\nfelt as though he lived in hell.

Just what do we mean by\nthat, and just what do we do?\nThe first requirement was that we be convinced that any life run on self-will\ncould hardly be a success. On that basis we are almost always in collision with\nsomething or somebody, even though our motives are good.\nHOW IT WORKS 73\nMost people try to live by self-propulsion. Each person is like an actor who\nwants to run the whole show: is forever trying to arrange the lights, the ballet,\nthe scenery and the rest of the players in his own way. If his arrangements\nwould only stay put, if only people would do as he wishes, the show would be\ngreat. Everybody, including himself, would be pleased. Life would be wonder-\nful. In trying to make these arrangements our actor may sometimes be quite\nvirtuous. He may be kind, considerate, patient, generous; even modest and\nself-sacrificing. On the other hand, he may be mean, egotistical, selfish and\ndishonest. But, as with most humans, he is more likely to have varied traits.\nWhat usually happens? The show doesn’t come off very well. He begins to\nthink life doesn’t treat him right. He decides to exert himself some more. He\nbecomes, on the next occasion, still more demanding or gracious, as the case\nmay be. Still the play does not suit him. Admitting he may be somewhat at fault,\nhe is sure that other people are more to blame. He becomes angry, indignant,\nself-pitying. What is his basic trouble? Is he not really a self-seeker even when\ntrying to be kind? Is he not a victim of the delusion that he can wrest satisfaction\nand happiness out of this world if he only manages well? Is it not evident to all\nthe rest of the players that these are the things he wants? And do not his actions\nmake each of them wish to retaliate, snatching all they can get out of the show?\nIs he not, even in his best moments, a producer of confusion rather than har-\nmony? Our actor is self-centered—egocentric, as people like\n74 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nto call it nowadays. He is like the retired business man who lolls in the Florida\nsunshine in the winter complaining of the sad state of the nation; the minister\nwho sighs over the sins of the twentieth century; politicians and reformers\nwho are sure all would be Utopia if the rest of the world would only behave;\nthe outlaw safe cracker who thinks society has wronged him; and the alcoholic\nwho has lost all and is locked up. Whatever their protestations, are not most of\nus concerned with ourselves, our resentments, or our self-pity? Selfishness—\nself-centeredness! That, we think, is the root of our troubles. Driven by a hun-\ndred forms of fear, selfdelusion, self-seeking, and self-pity, we step on the toes\nof our fellows and they retaliate. Sometimes they hurt us, seemingly, without\nprovocation, but we invariably find that at some time in the past we have made\ndecisions based on self, which later placed us in a position to be hurt.\nSo our troubles, we think, are basically of our own making. They arise out of\nourselves, and the alcoholic is an extreme example of self-will run riot, though\nhe usually doesn’t think so. Above everything, we alcoholics must be rid of\nthis selfishness. We must, or it kills us! God makes that possible. And there\noften seems no way of entirely getting rid of self without Him. Many of us had\n37",

Relieve me of the bondage of self, that I may better do Thy will.\nTake away my difficulties, that victory over them may bear witness to those I\nwould help of Thy Power, Thy Love, and Thy Way of life. May I do Thy will\nalways!“ We thought well before taking this step making sure we were ready;\nthat we could at last abandon ourselves utterly to Him.\nWe found it very desirable to take this spiritual step with an understanding\nperson, such as our wife, best\n76 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nfriend, or spiritual adviser. But it is better to meet God alone than with one\nwho might misunderstand. The wording was, of course, quite optional so long\nas we expressed the idea, voicing it without reservation.

But with the alcoholic whose\nhope is the maintenance and growth of a spiritual experience, this business of\nresentment is infinitely grave. We found that it is fatal.

We asked God to help us show\nthem the same tolerance, pity, and patience that we would cheerfully grant a\nsick friend. When a person offended we said to ourselves ‘This is a sick man.\nHow can I be helpful to him? God save me from being angry. Thy will be\ndone.“\nWe avoid retaliation or argument. We wouldn’t treat sick people that way. If\nwe do, we destroy our chance of being helpful. We cannot be helpful to all\npeople, but at least God will show us how to take a kindly and tolerant view of\neach and every one.\nReferring to our list again. Putting out of our minds the wrongs others had\ndone, we resolutely looked for our own mistakes. Where had we been selfish,\ndishonest, self-seeking and frightened? Though a situation had not been en-\ntirely our fault, we tried to disregard the\n80 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nother person involved entirely. Where were we to blame? The inventory was\nours, not the other man’s. When we saw our faults we listed them. We placed\nthem before us in black and white. We admitted our wrongs honestly and were\nwilling to set these matters straight.\nNotice that the word fear is bracketed alongside the difficulties with Mr.\nBrown, Mrs. Jones, the employer, and the wife. This short word somehow\ntouches about every aspect of our lives. It was an evil and corroding thread; the\nfabric of our existence was shot through with it. It set in motion trains of cir-\ncumstances which brought us misfortune we felt we didn’t deserve. But did\nnot we, ourselves, set the ball rolling? Sometimes we think fear ought to be\nclassed with stealing. It seems to cause more trouble.\n40",

Wasn’t it because selfreliance failed us? Self-reliance was good as far as\nit went, but it didn’t go far enough. Some of us once had great self-confidence,\nbut it didn’t fully solve the fear problem, or any other. When it made us cocky,\nit was worse.\nPerhaps there is a better way—we think so. For we are now on a different\nbasis; the basis of trusting and relying upon God. We trust infinite God rather\nthan our finite selves. We are in the world to play the role He assigns. Just to\nthe extent that we do as we think He would have us, and humbly rely on Him,\ndoes He enable us to match calamity with serenity.\nHOW IT WORKS 81\nWe never apologize to anyone for depending upon our Creator. We can laugh\nat those who think spirituality the way of weakness. Paradoxically, it is the\nway of strength. The verdict of the ages is that faith means courage. All men of\nfaith have courage. They trust their God. We never apologize for God. Instead\nwe let Him demonstrate, through us, what He can do. We ask Him to remove\nour fear and direct our attention to what He would have us be. At once, we\ncommence to outgrow fear.\nNow about sex. Many of us needed an overhauling there. But above all, we\ntried to be sensible on this question. It’s so easy to get way off the track. Here\nwe find human opinions running to extremes—absurd extremes, perhaps. One\nset of voices cry that sex is a lust of our lower nature, a base necessity of\nprocreation. Then we have the voices who cry for sex and more sex; who be-\nwail the institution of marriage; who think that most of the troubles of the race\nare traceable to sex causes. They think we do not have enough of it, or that it\nisn’t the right kind. They see its significance everywhere. One school would\nallow man no flavor for his fare and the other would have us all on a straight\npepper diet. We want to stay out of this controversy. We do not want to be the\narbiter of anyone’s sex conduct. We all have sex problems. We’d hardly be\nhuman if we didn’t. What can we do about them?\nWe reviewed our own conduct over the years past. Where had we been self-\nish, dishonest, or inconsiderate? Whom had we hurt? Did we unjustifiably\narouse jealousy, suspicion or bitterness? Where were we at\n82 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nfault, what should we have done instead? We got this all down on paper and\nlooked at it.\nIn this way we tried to shape a sane and sound ideal for our future sex life.\nWe subjected each relation to this test-was it selfish or not? We asked God to\nmold our ideals and help us to live up to them. We remembered always that our\nsex powers were God-given, and therefore good, neither to be used lightly or\nselfishly nor to be despised and loathed. Whatever our ideal turns out to be, we\nmust be willing to grow toward it. We must be willing to make amends where\nwe have done harm, provided that we do not bring about still more harm in so\ndoing. In other words, we treat sex as we would any other problem. In medita-\ntion, we ask God what we should do about each specific matter. The right\nanswer will come, if we want it.\nGod alone can judge our sex situation.

But they had not\nlearned enough of humility, fearlessness and honesty, in the sense we find it\nnecessary, until they told someone else all their life story.\nMore than most people, the alcoholic leads a double life.

Our thought life will be placed on a much higher plane\nwhen our thinking is cleared of wrong motives.\nIn thinking about our day we may face indecision. We may not be able to\ndetermine which course to take. Here we ask God for inspiration, an intuitive\nthought or a decision. We relax and take it easy. We don’t struggle. We are\noften surprised how the right answers come after we have tried this a while.\nWhat used to be the hunch or the occasional inspiration gradually becomes a\nworking part of the mind. Being still inexperienced and just making conscious\ncontact with God, it is not probable that we are going to be inspired at all\ntimes. We might pay for this presumption in all sorts of absurd actions and\nideas. Nevertheless we find that our thinking will, as time passes, be more and\nmore on the plane of inspiration. We come to rely upon it.\n49",

Under these conditions we naturally made\nmistakes. Some of them rose out of ignorance of alcoholism. Sometimes we\nsensed dimly that we were dealing with sick men.

His drinking may be con-\nstant or it may be heavy only on certain occasions. Perhaps he spends too\nmuch money for liquor. It may be slowing him up mentally and physically, but\nhe does not see it. Sometimes he is a source of embarrassment to you and his\nfriends. He is positive he can handle his liquor, that it does him no harm, that\ndrinking is necessary in his business. He would probably be insulted if called\nan alcoholic. This world is full of people like him. Some will moderate or stop\naltogether, and some will not. Of those who keep on, a good number will be-\ncome true alcoholics after a while.\nTwo: Your husband is showing lack of control, for he is unable to stay on the\nwater wagon, even when he wants to. He often gets entirely out of hand when\ndrinking. He admits this is true, but is positive that he will do better. He has\nbegun to try, with or without your cooperation, various means of moderating\nor staying dry. Maybe he is beginning to lose his friends. His business may\nsuffer somewhat. He is worried at times, and is becoming aware that he cannot\ndrink like other people. He sometimes drinks in the morning, and through the\nday also, to hold his nervousness in check. He is remorseful after serious drink-\ning bouts and tells you he wants to stop. But when he gets over the spree, he\nbegins to think once more how he can drink mod-\nTO WIVES 123\nerately next time. We think this person is in danger. These are the earmarks of\na real alcoholic. Perhaps he can still tend to business fairly well. He has by no\nmeans ruined everything.

His friends have slipped\naway, his home is a near-wreck, and he cannot hold a position. Maybe the\ndoctor has been called in, and the weary round of sanitariums and hospitals\nhas begun.

He may have come\nto the point where he desperately wants to stop but cannot. His case presents\nadditional questions which we shall try to answer for you. You can be quite\nhopeful of a situation like this.\nFour: You may have a husband of whom you completely despair. He has\nbeen placed in one institution after another. He is violent, or appears definitely\ninsane, when drunk. Sometimes he drinks on the way home from the hospital.\nPerhaps he has had delirium tremens. Doctors may shake their heads and ad-\nvise you to have him committed. Maybe you have already been obliged to put\nhim away. This picture may not be as dark as it looks.

Perhaps they created the impression that he\nis to be wrapped in cotton wool and placed on a pedestal. Successful readjust-\nment means the opposite. All members of the family should meet upon the\ncommon ground of tolerance, understanding, and love. This involves a process\nof deflation. The alcoholic, his wife, his children, his ”in-laws,“ each one is\nlikely to have fixed ideas about the family’s attitude towards himself or her-\nself. Each is interested in having his or her wishes respected. We find the more\none member of a family demands that the others concede to him, the more\nresentful they become. This makes for discord and unhappiness.\nAnd why? Is it not because each wants to play the lead? Is not each trying to\narrange the family show to his liking? Is he not unconsciously trying to see\nwhat he can take from the family life, rather than give?\nCessation of drinking is but the first step away from a highly strained, abnor-\nmal condition. A doctor said to us, ”Years of living with an alcoholic is almost\nsure to make any wife or child neurotic. The entire family is, to some extent,\nill.“ Let families realize, as they start their journey, that all will not be fair\nweather. Each in\n136 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nhis turn may be footsore and may straggle. There will be alluring shortcuts\nand by-paths down which they may wander and lose their way.\nSuppose we tell you some of the obstacles a family will meet; suppose we\nsuggest how they may be avoided—even converted to good use for others. The\nfamily of an alcoholic longs for the return of happiness and security. They\nremember when father was romantic, thoughtful, and successful. Today’s life\nis measured against that of other years and, when it falls short, the family may\nbe unhappy. Family confidence in dad is rising high. The good old days will\nsoon be back, they think. Sometimes they demand that dad bring them back\ninstantly! God, they believe, almost owes this recompense on a long overdue\naccount. But the head of the house has spent years in pulling down the struc-\ntures of business, romance, friendship, health—these things are now ruined or\ndamaged. It will take time to clear away the wreck. Though old buildings will\neventually be replaced by finer ones, the new structures will take years to com-\nplete. Father knows he is to blame; it may take him many seasons of hard work\nto be restored financially, but he shouldn’t be reproached. Perhaps he will never\nhave much money again.

The first impulse will be to\nTHE FAMILY AFTERWARD 137\nbury these skeletons in a dark closet and padlock the door. The family may be\npossessed by the idea that future happiness can be based only upon forgetful-\nness of the past. We think that such a view is quite self-centered and in direct\nconflict with the new way of living.\nHenry Ford once made a wise remark to the effect that experience is the\nthing of supreme value in life. That is true only if one is willing to turn the past\nto good account. We grow by our willingness to face and rectify errors and\nconvert them into assets. The alcoholic’s past thus becomes the principal asset\nof the family, and frequently it is almost the only one!\nThis painful past may be of infinite value to other families still struggling\nwith their problem. We think each family which has been relieved owes some-\nthing to those which have not, and when the occasion requires, each member\nof it, should be only too willing to bring former mistakes, no matter how griev-\nous, out of their hiding places. Showing others who suffer how we were given\nhelp, is the very thing which makes life seem so worth while to us now. Cling\nto the thought that, in God’s hands, the dark past is the greatest possession you\nhave—the key to life and happiness for others. With it you can avert death and\nmisery for them.\nIt is possible to dig up past misdeeds so they become a blight, a veritable\nplague. For example, we know of situations in which the alcoholic or his wife\nhave had love affairs. In the first flush of spiritual experience they forgave\neach other and drew closer together. The\n138 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nmiracle of reconciliation was at hand. Then, under one provocation or another,\nthe aggrieved one would unearth the old affair and angrily cast its ashes about.\nA few of us have had these growing pains and they hurt a great deal. Husbands\nand wives have sometimes been obliged to separate for a time until new per-\nspective, new victory over hurt pride, could be rewon. In most cases, the alco-\nholic survived this ordeal without relapse, but not always. So we think that\nunless some good and useful purpose is to be served, past occurrences should\nnot be discussed.\nWe families of Alcoholics Anonymous keep few skeletons in the closet. Eve-\nryone knows about the others alcoholic troubles. This is a condition which, in\nordinary life, would produce untold grief; there might be scandalous gossip,\nlaughter at the expense of other people, and a tendency to take advantage of\nintimate information. Among us, these are rare occurrences. We do talk about\neach other a great deal but almost invariably temper such talk by a spirit of\nlove and tolerance.\nAnother principle we observe carefully is that we do not relate intimate ex-\nperiences of another person unless we are sure he would approve. We find it\nbetter, when possible, to stick to our own stories. A man may criticize or laugh\nat himself and it will affect others favorably, but criticism or ridicule of him\ncoming from another often produces the contrary effect. Members of a family\nshould watch such matters carefully, for one careless, inconsiderate remark\nhas been known to raise the very devil. We alcoholics are sensitive people.\n67",

    "text": "THE FAMILY AFTERWARD 139\nIt takes some of us a long time to outgrow that serious handicap.\nMany alcoholics are enthusiasts. They run to extremes. At the beginning of\nrecovery a man will take, as a rule, one of two directions. He may either plunge\ninto a frantic attempt to get on his feet in business, or he may be so enthralled\nby his new life that he talks or thinks of little else. In either case certain family\nproblems will arise. With these we have experience galore.\nWe think it dangerous if he rushes headlong at his economic problem. The\nfamily will be affected also, pleasantly at first, as they feel their money trou-\nbles are to be solved, then not so pleasantly as they find themselves neglected.\nDad may be tired at night and preoccupied by day. He may take small interest\nin the children and may show irritation when reproved for his delinquencies. If\nnot irritable, he may seem dull and boring, not gay and affectionate, as the\nfamily would like him to be. Mother may complain of inattention. They are all\ndisappointed, and often let him feel it. Beginning with such complaints, a bar-\nrier arises. He is straining every nerve to make up for lost time. He is striving\nto recover fortune and reputation and feels he is doing very well.\nSometimes mother and children don’t think so. Having been neglected and\nmisused in the past, they think father owes them more than they are getting.\nThey want him to make a fuss over them. They expect him to give them the\nnice times they used to have before he drank so much, and to show his contri-\ntion for what they suffered. But dad doesn’t give freely of himself.\n140 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nResentment grows. He becomes still less communicative. Sometimes he ex-\nplodes over a trifle. The family is mystified. They criticize, pointing out how\nhe is falling down on his spiritual program.\nThis sort of thing can be avoided. Both father and the family are mistaken,\nthough each side may have some justification. It is of little use to argue and\nonly makes the impasse worse. The family must realize that dad, though\nmarvelously improved, is still convalescing. They should be thankful he is sober\nand able to be of this world once more. Let them praise his progress. Let them\nremember that his drinking wrought all kinds of damage that may take long to\nrepair. If they sense these things, they will not take so seriously his periods of\ncrankiness, depression, or apathy, which will disappear when there is tolerance,\nlove, and spiritual understanding.\nThe head of the house ought to remember that he is mainly to blame for\nwhat befell his home. He can scarcely square the account in his lifetime. But\nhe must see the danger of overconcentration on financial success. Although\nfinancial recovery is on the way for many of us, we found we could not place\nmoney first. For us, material well-being always followed spiritual progress, it\nnever preceded.\nSince the home has suffered more than anything else, it is well that a man\nexert himself there. He is not likely to get far in any direction if he fails to show\nunselfishness and love under his own roof. We know there are difficult wives\nand families, but the man who is getting\nTHE FAMILY AFTERWARD 141\nover alcoholism must remember he did much to make them so. As each mem-\nber of a resentful family begins to see his shortcomings and admits them to the\nothers, he lays a basis for helpful discussion. These family talks will be con-\n68",

Little by little, mother and children will\nsee they ask too much, and father will see he gives too little. Giving, rather\nthan getting, will become the guiding principle.\nAssume on the other hand that father has, at the out-set, a stirring spiritual\nexperience. Over-night, as it were, he is a different man. He becomes a reli-\ngious enthusiast. He is unable to focus on anything else. As soon as his sobri-\nety begins to be taken as a matter of course, the family may look at their strange\nnew dad with apprehension, then with irritation. There is talk about spiritual\nmatters morning, noon and night. He may demand that the family find God in\na hurry, or exhibit amazing indifference to them and say he is above worldly\nconsiderations. He may tell mother, who has been religious all her life, that\nshe doesn’t know what it’s all about, and that she had better get his brand of\nspirituality while there is yet time.\nWhen father takes this tack, the family may react unfavorably. They may be\njealous of a God who has stolen dad’s affections. While grateful that he drinks\nno more, they may not like the idea that God has accomplished the miracle\nwhere they failed. They often forget father was beyond human aid. They may\nnot see\n142 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nwhy their love and devotion did not straighten him out. Dad is not so spiritual\nafter all, they say. If he means to right his past wrongs, why all this concern for\neveryone in the world but his family? What about his talk that God will take\ncare of them? They suspect father is a bit balmy!\nHe is not so unbalanced as they might think. Many of us have experienced\ndad’s elation. We have indulged in spiritual intoxication. Like a gaunt prospec-\ntor, belt drawn in over the last ounce of food, our pick struck gold. Joy at our\nrelease from a lifetime of frustration knew no bounds. Father feels he has struck\nsomething better than gold. For a time he may try to hug the new treasure to\nhimself. He may not see at once that he has barely scratched a limitless lode\nwhich will pay dividends only if he mines it for the rest of his life and insists\non giving away the entire product.\nIf the family cooperates, dad will soon see that he is suffering from a distor-\ntion of values. He will perceive that his spiritual growth is lopsided, that for an\naverage man like himself, a spiritual life which does not include his family\nobligations may not be so perfect after all. If the family will appreciate that\ndad’s current behavior is but a phase of his development, all will be well. In the\nmidst of an understanding and sympathetic family, these vagaries of dad’s spir-\nitual infancy will quickly disappear.\nThe opposite may happen should the family condemn and criticize. Dad\nmay feel that for years his drinking has placed him on the wrong side of every\nargument, but that now he has become a superior person,\nTHE FAMILY AFTERWARD 143\nwith God on his side. If the family persists in criticism, this fallacy may take a\nstill greater hold on father. Instead of treating the family as he should, he may\nretreat further into himself and feel he has spiritual justification for so doing.\nThough the family does not fully agree with dad’s spiritual activities, they\nshould let him have his head. Even if he displays a certain amount of neglect\nand irresponsibility towards the family, it is well to let him go as far as he likes\n69",

Though some of his manifes-\ntations are alarming and disagreeable, we think dad will be on a firmer founda-\ntion than the man who is placing business or professional success ahead of\nspiritual development. He will be less likely to drink again, and anything is\npreferable to that.\nThose of us who have spent much time in the world of spiritual make-be-\nlieve have eventually seen the childishness of it. This dream world has been\nreplaced by a great sense of purpose, accompanied by a growing conscious-\nness of the power of God in our lives. We have come to believe He would like\nus to keep our heads in the clouds with Him, but that our feet ought to be\nfirmly planted on earth, nevertheless. That is where our fellow travelers are,\nand that is where our work must be done. These are the realities for us. We\nhave found nothing incompatible between a powerful spiritual experience, and\na life of sane and happy usefulness.\nOne more suggestion: Whether the family has spiritual convictions or not,\nthey may do well to examine the\n144 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nprinciples by which the alcoholic member is trying to live. They can hardly\nfail to approve these simple principles, though the head of the house still fails\nsome-what in practicing them. Nothing will help the man who is off on a spir-\nitual tangent so much as the wife who adopts a sane spiritual program, making\na better practical use of it. There will be other profound changes in the house-\nhold. Liquor incapacitated father for so many years that mother became head\nof the house. She met these responsibilities gallantly. By force of circumstances,\nshe was often obliged to treat father as a sick or wayward child. Even when he\nwanted to assert himself, he could not, for his drinking placed him constantly in\nthe wrong. Mother made all the plans and gave the directions. When sober, fa-\nther usually obeyed. Thus mother, through no fault of her own, became accus-\ntomed to wearing the family trousers. Father, coming suddenly to life again,\noften begins to assert himself. This means trouble, unless the family watches for\nthese tendencies in each other and come to a friendly agreement about them.\nDrinking isolates most homes from the outside world. Father may have laid\naside for years all normal activities—clubs, civic duties, sports. When he re-\nnews interest in such things, a feeling of jealousy may arise. The family may\nfeel they hold a mortgage on dad, so big that no equity should be left for out-\nsiders. Instead of developing new channels of activity for themselves, mother\nand children may demand that he stay home and make up the deficiency.\nTHE FAMILY AFTERWARD 145\nAt the very beginning, the couple ought to frankly face the fact that each will\nhave to yield here and there, if the family is going to play an effective part in\nthe new life. Father will necessarily spend much time with other alcoholics,\nbut this activity should be balanced. New acquaintances who know nothing of\nalcoholism might be made and thoughtful consideration given their needs. The\nproblems of the community might engage attention. Though the family has no\nreligious connections, they may wish to make contact with, or take member-\nship in a religious body.\nAlcoholics who have derided religious people will be helped by such con-\ntacts.

I had discharged him for drinking six weeks\nbefore.\nStill another experience: A woman’s voice came faintly over long distance\nfrom Virginia. She wanted to know if her husband’s company insurance was\nstill in force. Four days before he had hanged himself in his woodshed. I had\nbeen obliged to discharge him for drinking, though he was brilliant, alert, and\none of the best organizers I have ever known.\nHere were three exceptional men lost to this world because I did not under-\nstand alcoholism as I do now.

This seemed to me like an opportunity to be helpful, so I spent\ntwo hours talking about alcoholism, the malady, and described the symptoms\nand results as well as I could. His comment was: ”Very interesting. But I’m\nsure this man is done drinking. He has just returned from a threemonths’ leave\nof absence, has taken a cure, looks fine, and to clinch the matter, the board of\ndirectors told him this was his last chance.“\nThe only answer I could make was that if the man followed the usual pat-\ntern, he would go on a bigger bust than ever. I felt this was inevitable and\nwondered if the bank were doing the man an injustice. Why not bring him in\ncontact with some of our alcoholic crowd? He might have a chance.

If he feels free to discuss his problems with you, if he knows you\nunderstand, and will not be upset by anything he wishes to say, he will prob-\nably be off to a fast start.\nIn this connection, can you remain undisturbed if the man proceeds to tell\nyou shocking things? He may, for example, reveal that he has padded his ex-\npense account, or that he has planned to take your best customers away from\nyou. In fact, he may say almost anything if he has accepted our solution, which,\nas you know, demands rigorous honesty. Can you charge this off as you would\na bad account and start fresh with him? If he owes you money you may wish to\nmake terms.\nIf he speaks of his home situation, you can undoubtedly make helpful sug-\ngestions. Can he talk frankly with you so long as he does not bear business\ntales or criticize his associates? With this kind of employee such an attitude\nwill command undying loyalty.\nThe greatest enemies of we alcoholics are resentment, jealousy, envy, frus-\ntration, and fear. Wherever men are gathered together in business, there will be\nrivalries, and, arising out of these, a certain amount of office politics. Some-\ntimes we alcoholics have an idea that people are trying to pull us down. Often\nthis is not so\n160 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nat all. But sometimes our drinking will be used politically. One instance comes\nto mind in which a malicious individual was always making friendly little\njokes about an alcoholic’s drinking exploits. In this way he was slyly carrying\ntales. In another case, an alcoholic was sent to a hospital for treatment. Only a\nfew knew of it at first, but within a short time, it was bill-boarded throughout\nthe entire company. Naturally this sort of thing decreased the man’s chance of\nrecovery. The employer can many times protect the victim from this kind of\ntalk. The employer cannot play favorites, but he can always defend a man from\nneedless provocation and unfair criticism.\nAs a class, alcoholics are energetic people. They work hard and they play\nhard. Your man should be on his mettle to make good. Being somewhat weak-\nened, and faced with physical and mental readjustment to a life which knows\nno alcohol, he may overdo. You may have to curb his desire to work sixteen\nhours a day. You may need to encourage him to play once in a while. He may\n77",

If you are an alcoholic, you\nare a mighty sick man. You act like one. The firm wants to help you get over it,\nand if you are interested, there is a way out. If you do, your past will be forgot-\nten and the fact that you went away for treatment will not be mentioned. But if\nyou cannot, or will not stop drinking, I think you ought to resign.“\nYour junior executive may not agree with the contents of our book. He need\nnot, and often should not, show it to his alcoholic prospect. But at least he will\nunderstand the problem and will no longer be misled by ordinary promises. He\nwill be able to take a position with such a man which is eminently fair and\nsquare. He will have no further reason for covering up an alcoholic employee.\nIt boils right down to this: No man should be fired just because he is alco-\nholic. If he wants to stop, he should be afforded a real chance. If he cannot, or\ndoes not want to stop, he should be discharged. The exceptions are few.\n78",

Here is a brief account:\nNearly four years ago, one of our number made a journey to a certain west-\nern city. From the business standpoint, his trip came off badly. Had he been\nsuccessful in his enterprise, he would have been set on his feet financially,\nwhich, at the time, seemed vitally important. But his venture wound up in a\nlaw suit and bogged down completely. The proceeding was shot through with\nmuch hard feeling and controversy. Bitterly discouraged, he found himself in a\nstrange place, discredited and almost broke. Still physically weak, and sober\nbut a few months, he saw that his predicament was dangerous. He wanted so\nmuch to talk with someone, but whom? One dismal afternoon he paced a hotel\nlobby wondering how his bill was to be paid. At one end of the room stood a\nglass covered directory of local churches. Down the lobby a door opened into\nan attractive bar. He could see the gay crowd inside. In there he would find\ncompanionship and release. Unless he took some drinks, he might not have the\ncourage to scrape an acquaintance, and would have a lonely weekend.\nOf course, he couldn’t drink, but why not sit hopefully at a table, a bottle of\nginger ale before him? Then after all, had he not been sober six months now?\nPerhaps he could handle, say, three drinks—no more! Fear gripped him. He\nwas on thin ice. Again it was the old, insidious insanity—that first drink. With\na shiver, he turned away and walked down the lobby to the\nA VISION FOR YOU 169\nchurch directory. Music and gay chatter still floated to him from the bar.\nBut what about his responsibilities—his family and the men who would die\nbecause they would not know how to get well, ah—yes, those other alcohol-\nics? There must be many such in this town. He would phone a clergyman. His\nsanity returned, and he thanked God. Selecting a church at random from the\ndirectory, he stepped into a booth and lifted the receiver. His call to the clergy-\nman led him presently to a certain resident of the town, who, though formerly\nable and respected, was then nearing the nadir of alcoholic despair. It was the\nusual situation: home in jeopardy, wife ill, children distracted, bills in arrears,\nand standing damaged. He had a desperate desire to stop, but saw no way out;\nfor he had earnestly tried many avenues of escape. Painfully aware of being\nsomehow abnormal, the man did not fully realize what it means to be alco-\nholic.\nWhen our friend related his experience, the man agreed that no amount of\nwill power he might muster could stop his drinking for long. A spiritual expe-\nrience, he conceded, was absolutely necessary, but the price seemed high upon\nthe basis suggested. He told how he lived in constant worry about those who\nmight find out about his alcoholism. He had, of course, the familiar alcoholic\nobsession that few knew of his drinking.

Some time later,\nand just as he thought he was getting control of his liquor situation, he went on\na roaring bender. For him, this was the spree that ended all sprees. He saw that\nhe would have to face his problems squarely, that God might give him mastery.\nOne morning he took the bull by the horns and set out to tell those he feared\nwhat his trouble had been. He found himself surprisingly well received, and\nlearned that many knew of his drinking. Stepping into his car, he made the\nrounds of people he had hurt. He trembled as he went about, for this might\nmean ruin, particularly to a person in his line of business.\nAt midnight he came home exhausted, but very happy. He has not had a\ndrink since. As we shall see, he now means a great deal to his community, and\nthe major liabilities of thirty years of hard drinking have been repaired in four.\nBut life was not easy for the two friends.

The use of spiritual prin-\nciples in such cases was not so well understood as it is now. But one of the\nfriends said, ”Put him in a private room. We’ll be down.“ Two days later, a\nfuture Fellow of Alcoholics Anonymous stared glassily at the strangers beside\nhis bed. ”Who are you fellows, and why this private room? I was always in a\nward before.“\nSaid one of the visitors, ”We’re giving you a treatment for alcoholism.“\nHopelessness was written large on the man’s face as he replied: ”Oh, but\nthat’s no use. Nothing would fix me. I’m a goner. The last three times, I got\ndrunk on the way home from here. I’m afraid to go out the door. I can’t under-\nstand it.“\nFor an hour, the two friends told him about their drinking experiences. Over\nand over, he would say: ”That’s me. That’s me. I drink like that.“\nThe man in the bed was told of the acute poisoning from which he suffered,\nhow it deteriorates the body of an alcoholic and warps his mind. There was\nmuch talk about the mental state preceding the first drunk.\n”Yes, that’s me,“ said the sick man, ”the very image. You fellows know your\nstuff all right, but I don’t see what good it’ll do. You fellows are somebody. I\nwas once, but I’m a nobody now.

He had been thinking it over.\n”Maybe you’re right,“ he said. ”God ought to be able to do anything.“ Then he\nadded, ”He sure didn’t do much for me when I was trying to fight this booze\nracket alone.“\nOn the third day the lawyer gave his life to the care and direction of his\nCreator, and said he was perfectly willing to do anything necessary. His wife\ncame, scarcely daring to be hopeful, but she thought she saw something differ-\nent about her husband already. He had begun to have a spiritual experience.\nThat afternoon he put on his clothes and walked from the hospital a free man.\nHe entered a political campaign, making speeches, frequenting men’s gathering\nplaces of all sorts, often staying up all night. He lost the race by only a narrow\nmargin. But he had found God—and in finding God had found himself.\nThat was in June, 1935. He never drank again.

No\nbeer or liquor was sold in the neighborhood, except at the State liquor agency\nwhere perhaps one might procure a pint if he could convince the agent that he\nreally needed it. Without this proof the expectant purchaser would be forced to\ndepart empty handed with none of what I later came to believe was the great\npanacea for all human ills. Men who had liquor shipped in from Boston or\nNew York by express were looked upon with great distrust and disfavor by\nmost of the good townspeople. The town was well supplied with churches and\nschools in which I pursued my early educational activities.\nMy father was a professional man of recognized ability and both my father\nand mother were most active in church affairs. Both father and mother were\nconsiderably above the average in intelligence.\nUnfortunately for me I was the only child, which perhaps engendered the\nselfishness which played such an important part in bringing on my alcoholism.\nFrom childhood through high school I was more or less forced to go to church,\nSunday School and evening service, Monday night Christian Endeavor and\nsometimes to Wednesday evening prayer meeting. This had the effect of mak-\ning me resolve that when I was free\n184 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nfrom parental domination, I would never again darken the doors of a church.\nThis resolution I kept steadfastly for the next forty years, except when circum-\nstances made it seem unwise to absent myself.\nAfter high school came four years in one of the best colleges in the country\nwhere drinking seemed to be a major extra-curricular activity.

I seemed to be able to snap back the next\nmorning better than most of my fellow drinkers, who were cursed (or perhaps\nblessed) with a great deal of morning-after nausea. Never once in my life have\nI had a headache, which fact leads me to believe that I was an alcoholic almost\nfrom the start. My whole life seemed to be centered around doing what I wanted\nto do, without regard for the rights, wishes, or privileges of anyone else; a state\nof mind which became more and more predominant as the years passed. I was\ngraduated with ”summa cum laude“ in the eyes of the drinking fraternity, but\nnot in the eyes of the Dean.\nThe next three years I spent in Boston, Chicago, and Montreal in the employ\nof a large manufacturing concern, selling railway supplies, gas engines of all\nsorts, and many other items of heavy hardware. During these years, I drank as\nmuch as my purse permitted, still without paying too great a penalty, although\nI was beginning to have morning ”jitters“ at times. I lost only a half day’s work\nduring these three years.\nMy next move was to take up the study of medicine, entering one of the\nlargest universities in the country.\nTHE DOCTOR’S NIGHTMARE 185\nThere I took up the business of drinking with much greater earnestness than\nI had previously shown. On account of my enormous capacity for beer, I was\nelected to membership in one of the drinking societies, and soon became one\nof the leading spirits. Many mornings I have gone to classes, and even though\nfully prepared, would turn and walk back to the fraternity house because of my\njitters, not daring to enter the classroom for fear of making a scene should I be\ncalled on for recitation.\nThis went from bad to worse until sophomore spring when, after a prolonged\nperiod of drinking, I made up my mind that I could not complete my course, so\nI packed my grip and went South and spent a month on a large farm owned by\na friend of mine. When I got the fog out of my brain, I decided that quitting\nschool was very foolish and that I had better return and continue my work.\nWhen I reached school, I discovered the faculty had other ideas on the subject.\nAfter much argument they allowed me to return and take my exams, all of\nwhich I passed creditably. But they were much disgusted and told me they\nwould attempt to struggle along without my presence. After many painful dis-\ncussions, they finally gave me my credits and I migrated to another of the\nleading universities of the country and entered as a Junior that Fall.\nThere my drinking became so much worse that the boys in the fraternity\nhouse where I lived felt forced to send for my father, who made a long journey\nin the vain endeavor to get me straightened around. This had\n186 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nlittle effect however for I kept on drinking and used a great deal more hard\nliquor than in former years.\nComing up to final exams I went on a particularly strenuous spree. When I\nwent in to write the examinations, my hand trembled so I could not hold a\npencil. I passed in at least three absolutely blank books. I was, of course, soon\non the carpet and the upshot was that I had to go back for two more quarters\nand remain absolutely dry, if I wished to graduate. This I did, and proved my-\nself satisfactory to the faculty, both in deportment and scholastically.\n87",

    "text": "I conducted myself so creditably that I was able to secure a much coveted\ninternship in a western city, where I spent two years. During these two years I\nwas kept so busy that I hardly left the hospital at all. Consequently, I could not\nget into any trouble.\nWhen those two years were up, I opened an office downtown.\nThen I had some money, all the time in the world, and considerable stomach\ntrouble. I soon discovered that a couple of drinks would alleviate my gastric\ndistress, at least for a few hours at a time, so it was not at all difficult for me to\nreturn to my former excessive indulgence.\nBy this time I was beginning to pay very dearly physically and, in hope of\nrelief, voluntarily incarcerated myself at least a dozen times in one of the local\nsanitariums. I was between Scylla and Charybdis now, because if I did not\ndrink my stomach tortured me, and if I did, my nerves did the same thing.\nAfter three years of this, I wound up in the local hospital where they attempted\nto help me, but I would get my friends\nTHE DOCTOR’S NIGHTMARE 187\nto smuggle me a quart, or I would steal the alcohol about the building, so that\nI got rapidly worse.\nFinally my father had to send a doctor out from my home town who man-\naged to get me back there some way and I was in bed about two months before\nI could venture out of the house. I stayed about town a couple of months more\nand returned to resume my practice. I think I must have been thoroughly scared\nby what had happened, or by the doctor, or probably both, so that I did not\ntouch a drink again until the country went dry.\nWith the passing of the Eighteenth Amendment I felt quite safe. I knew eve-\nryone would buy a few bottles, or cases, of liquor as their exchequers permit-\nted, and it would soon be gone. Therefore it would make no great difference,\neven if I should do some drinking. At that time I was not aware of the almost\nunlimited supply the government made it possible for us doctors to obtain,\nneither had I any knowledge of the bootlegger who soon appeared on the hori-\nzon. I drank with moderation at first, but it took me only a relatively short time\nto drift back into the old habits which had wound up so disastrously before.\nDuring the next few years, I developed two distinct phobias. One was the\nfear of not sleeping, and the other was the fear of running out of liquor. Not\nbeing a man of means, I knew that if I did not stay sober enough to earn money,\nI would run out of liquor. Most of the time, therefore, I did not take the morn-\ning drink which I craved so badly, but instead would fill up on large doses of\nsedatives to quiet the jitters, which distressed me terribly. Occasionally, I would\nyield to the\n188 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nmorning craving, but if I did, it would be only a few hours before I would be\nquite unfit for work. This would lessen my chances of smuggling some home\nthat evening, which in turn would mean a night of futile tossing around in bed\nfollowed by a morning of unbearable jitters. During the subsequent fifteen\nyears I had sense enough never to go to the hospital if I had been drinking, and\nvery seldom did I receive patients. T would sometimes hide out in one of the\nclubs of which I was a member, and had the habit at times of registering at a\nhotel under a fictitious name. But my friends usually found me and I would go\nhome if they promised that l should not be scolded.\n88",

    "text": "If my wife were planning to go out in the afternoon, I would get a large\nsupply of liquor and smuggle it home and hide it in the coal bin, the clothes\nchute, over door jambs, over beams in the cellar and in cracks in the cellar tile.\nI also made use of old trunks and chests, the old can container, and even the\nash container. The water tank on the toilet I never used, because that looked\ntoo easy. I found out later that my wife inspected it frequently. I used to put\neight or twelve ounce bottles of alcohol in a fur lined glove and toss it onto the\nback airing porch when winter days got dark enough. My bootlegger had hid-\nden alcohol at the back steps where I could get it at my convenience. Some-\ntimes I would bring it in my pockets, but they were inspected, and that became\ntoo risky. I used also to put it up in four ounce bottles and stick several in my\nstocking tops. This worked nicely until my wife and I went to see Wallace\nBeery in ”Tugboat Annie,“\nTHE DOCTOR’S NIGHTMARE 189\nafter which the pant-leg and stocking racket were out! I will not take space to\nrelate all my hospital or sanitarium experiences.\nDuring all this time we became more or less ostracized by our friends. We\ncould not be invited out because I would surely get tight and my wife dared not\ninvite people in for the same reason. My phobia for sleeplessness demanded\nthat I get drunk every night, but in order to get more liquor for the next night,\nI had to stay sober during the day, at least up to four o’clock. This routine went\non with few interruptions for seventeen years. It was really a horrible night-\nmare, this earning money, getting liquor, smuggling it home, getting drunk,\nmorning jitters, taking large doses of sedatives to make it possible for me to\nearn more money, and so on ad nauseam. I used to promise my wife, my friends,\nand my children that I would drink no more—promises which seldom kept me\nsober even through the day, though I was very sincere when I made them.\nFor the benefit of those experimentally inclined, I should mention the so-\ncalled beer experiment. When beer first came back, I thought that I was safe. I\ncould drink all I wanted of that. It was harmless; nobody ever got drunk on\nbeer. So I filled the cellar full, with the permission of my good wife. It was not\nlong before I was drinking at least a case and a half a day. I put on thirty\npounds weight in about two months, looked like a pig, and was uncomfortable\nfrom shortness of breath. It then occurred to me that after one was all smelled\nup with beer nobody could tell what had been drunk, so I began to fortify my\nbeer with straight\n190 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nalcohol. Of course, the result was very bad, and that ended the beer experi-\nment.\nAbout the time of the beer experiment I was thrown in with a crowd of\npeople who attracted me because of their seeming poise, health, and happi-\nness. They spoke with great freedom from embarrassment, which I could never\ndo, and they seemed very much at ease on all occasions and appeared very\nhealthy. More than these attributes, they seemed to be happy. I was self con-\nscious and ill at ease most of the time, my health was at the breaking point, and\nI was thoroughly miserable. I sensed they had something I did not have, from\nwhich I might readily profit. I learned that it was something of a spiritual na-\nture, which did not appeal to me very much, but I thought it could do no harm.\nI gave the matter much time and study for the next two and a half years, but\n89",

I read everything I could find, and talked\nto everyone who I thought knew anything about it.\nMy good wife became deeply interested and it was her interest that sus-\ntained mine, though I at no time sensed that it might be an answer to my liquor\nproblem. How my wife kept her faith and courage during all those years, I’ll\nnever know, but she did. If she had not, I know I would have been dead a long\ntime ago. For some reason, we alcoholics seem to have the gift of picking out\nthe world’s finest women. Why they should be subjected to the tortures we\ninflicted upon them, I cannot explain.\nAbout this time a lady called up my wife one Saturday afternoon, saying she\nwanted me to come over that\nTHE DOCTOR’S NIGHTMARE 191\nevening to meet a friend of hers who might help me. It was the day before\nMother’s Day and I had come home plastered, carrying a big potted plant which\nI set down on the table and forthwith went upstairs and passed out. The next\nday she called again. Wishing to be polite, though I felt very badly, I said,\n”Let’s make the call,“ and extracted from my wife a promise that we would not\nstay over fifteen minutes.\nWe entered her house at exactly five o’clock and it was eleven fifteen when\nwe left. I had a couple of shorter talks with this man afterward, and stopped\ndrinking abruptly. This dry spell lasted for about three weeks; Then I went to\nAtlantic City to attend several days’ meeting of a National Society of which I\nwas a member. I drank all the Scotch they had on the train and bought several\nquarts on my way to the hotel. This was on Sunday. I got tight that night,\nstayed sober Monday till after the dinner and then proceeded to get tight again.\nI drank all I dared in the bar, and then went to my room to finish the job.\nTuesday I started in the morning, getting well organized by noon. I did not\nwant to disgrace myself, so I then checked out. I bought some more liquor on\nthe way to the depot. I had to wait some time for the train. I remember nothing\nfrom then on until I woke up at a friend’s house, in a town near home. These\ngood people notified my wife, who sent my newly-made friend over to get me.\nHe came and got me home and to bed, gave me a few drinks that night, and one\nbottle of beer the next morning.\n192 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nThat was June 10, 1935, and that was my last drink. As I write nearly four\nyears have passed.\nThe question which might naturally come into your mind would be: ”what\ndid the man do or say that was different from what others had done or said?“ It\nmust be remembered that I had read a great deal and talked to everyone who\nknew, or thought they knew, anything about the subject of alcoholism. This\nman was a man who had experienced many years of frightful drinking, who\nhad had most all the drunkard’s experience known to man, but who had been\ncured by the very means I had been trying to employ, that is to say, the spiritual\napproach. He gave me information about the subject of alcoholism which was\nundoubtedly helpful. Of far more importance was the fact that he was the first\nliving human with whom I had ever talked, who knew what he was talking\nabout in regard to alcoholism from actual experience. In other words, he talked\nmy language. He knew all the answers, and certainly not because he had picked\nthem up in his reading.\n90",

But, although I was a good Catholic,\nthe monastic life had little appeal for me.\nVery early I became apprenticed to harness-making and acquired consider-\nable knowledge of upholstering. My daily consumption of wine was about a\nquart, but that was common where I lived. Everybody drank wine. And it is\ntrue that there was no great amount of drunkenness. But I can remember, in my\nteens, that there were a few characters who caused the village heads to nod\npityingly and sometimes in anger as they paused to say, ”That sot, Henri“ and\n”Ce pauvre Jules,“ who drank too much. They were undoubtedly the alcohol-\nics of our village.\nMilitary service was compulsory and I did my stretch with the class of my\nage, goose-stepping in German barracks and taking part in the Boxer Rebel-\nlion in China, my first time at any great distance from home. In foreign parts\nmany a soldier who has been abstemious at home learns to use new and potent\ndrinks. So I indulged with my comrades in everything the Far East had to\nTHE EUROPEAN DRINKER 207\noffer. I cannot say, however, that I acquired any craving for hard liquor as a\nresult. When I got back to Germany I settled down to finish my apprenticeship,\ndrinking the wine of the country as usual.\nMany friends of my family had emigrated to America, so at 24 I decided that\nthe United States offered me the opportunity I was never likely to find in my\nnative land. I came directly to a growing industrial city in the middle west,\nwhere I have lived practically ever since. I was warmly welcomed by friends\nof my youth who had preceded me. For weeks after my arrival I was feted and\nentertained in the already large colony of Alsatians in the city, among the Ger-\nmans in their saloons and clubs. I early decided that the wine of America was\nvery inferior stuff and took up beer instead.\nI soon found work at my trade in harness-making. It was still an age of\nhorses. But I discovered that harness and saddle-making in America was dif-\nferent than anything I had known. Every man in the shop was a specialist and\ninstead of having a variety of jobs to do every day, I was compelled to sit all\nday long at a bench doing the same thing endlessly. I found it very monoto-\nnous and, wanting a change, I found it when I got work as an upholsterer in a\nlarge furniture store.\nFond of singing, I joined a German singing society which had good club\nheadquarters. There I sat in the evenings, enjoying with my friends our memo-\nries of the ”old country,“ singing the old songs we all knew, playing simple\ncard games for drinks and consuming great quantities of beer.\nAt that time I could go into any saloon, have one or\n208 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\ntwo beers, walk out and forget about it. I had no desire whatever to sit down at\na table and stay a whole morning or afternoon drinking. Certainly at that time\nI was one of those who ‘”can take it or leave it alone.“ There had never been\nany drunkards in my family. I came of good stock, of men and women who\ndrank wine all their lives as a beverage, and while they occasionally got drunk\nat special celebrations, they were up and about their business the next day.\nProhibition came. Having regard for the law of the land, I resigned myself to\nthe will of the national legislators and quit drinking altogether, not because I\n97",

You can all remember that in the first few months after the change, a\ngreat many men, who had formerly been used to a few beers every day or an\noccasional drink of whiskey, simply quit all alcoholic drinks. For the great\nmajority of us, however, that condition didn’t last. We saw very early that pro-\nhibition wasn’t going to work. It wasn’t very long before home-brewing was\nan institution and men began to search feverishly for old recipe books on wine\nmaking.\nBut I hardly tasted anything for two years and started in business for myself,\nfounding a mattress factory which is today an important industrial enterprise\nin our city. I was doing very well with that and general upholstering work, and\nthere was every indication that I would be financially independent by the time\nI reached middle age. By this time I was married and was paying for a home.\nLike most immigrants I wanted to be some-\nTHE EUROPEAN DRINKER 209\nbody and have something and I was very happy and contented as I felt success\ncrown my efforts. I missed the old social times, of course, but had no definite\ncraving even for beer.\nSuccessful home-brewers among my friends began to invite me to their homes.\nI decided that if these fellows could make it I would try it myself and so I did.\nIt wasn’t very long until I had developed a pretty good brew with uniformity\nand plenty of authority. I knew the stuff I was making was a lot stronger than I\nhad been used to, but never suspected that steady drinking of it might develop\na taste for something even stronger.\nIt wasn’t long before the bootlegger was an established institution in this, as\nin other towns. I was doing well in business and in going around town I was\nfrequently invited to have a drink in a speakeasy. I condoned my domestic\nbrewing and the bootleggers and their business. More and more I formed the\nhabit of doing some of my business in the speakeasy and after a time did not\nneed that as an excuse. The ”speaks“ usually sold whiskey. Beer was too bulky\nand it couldn’t be kept in a jug under the counter ready to be dumped when\nJohn Law would come around. I was now forming an entirely new drinking\ntechnique. Before long I had a definite taste for hard liquor, knew nausea and\nheadaches I had never known before, but as in the old days, I suffered them\nout. Gradually, however, I’d suffer so much that I simply had to have the morn-\ning-after drink.\nI became what is called a periodical drinker. I was eased out of the business\nI had founded and was reduced\n210 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nto doing general upholstery in a small shop at the back of my house. My wife\nupbraided me often and plenty when she saw that my ”periodicals“ were gradu-\nally losing me what business I could get. I began to bring bottles in. I had them\nhidden away in the house and all over my shop in careful concealment. I had\nall the usual experiences of the alcoholic for I was certainly one by this time.\nSometimes, after sobering up after a bout of several weeks, I would right-\neously resolve to quit. With a great deal of determination, I would throw out\nfull pints—pour them out and smash the bottles—firmly resolved never to take\nanother drink of the stuff. I was going to straighten up.\n98",

As soon as I had satisfied\nthat, what I earned as an upholsterer went for liquor. I would promise to have\njobs done and never do them. My customers lost confidence in me to the point\nwhere I retained what business I had only because I was a well-trained and\nreputedly fine craftsman. ”Best in the business, when he’s sober,“ my custom-\ners would say and I still had a following who would give me work though they\ndeplored my habits because they knew the job would be well done when they\neventually got it.\nI had always been a good Catholic, possibly not so devoted as I should have\nbeen, but fairly regular in my\nTHE EUROPEAN DRINKER 211\nattendance at services. I had never doubted the existence of the Supreme Be-\ning but now I began to absent myself from my church where I had formerly\nbeen a member of the choir. Unfortunately, I had no desire to consult my priest\nabout my drinking. In fact I was scared to talk to him about it, for I feared the\nkind of talk he would give me. Unlike many other Catholics who frequently\ntake pledges for definite periods—a year, two years or for good, I never had\nany desire to ”take a pledge“ before the priest.

He was undoubtedly a fundamentalist with strong leanings to-\nward evangelistic preaching. He knew me and something of my reputation.\nMy wife asked him to help her if he could.

Well, there I was, lying in an alcoholic stupor with occasional flashes\nof emotional self-pity, in pretty much the same condition as the drunk who\nplunges to the sawdust at the appeal of a religious orator.\nGood, honest and sincere man, he prayed at my bed-side and I promised to\ngo to church with him to hear an evangelist. He didn’t wait for me to come to\nhis office, he came after me.\nI heard the evangelist but was not impressed. The service was entirely for-\neign to what I had been accustomed to in my religious observance since child-\nhood. I have no doubt of the preacher’s sincerity and seek not at all to belittle\nhis work, but I was unaffected. So I got no answer.\nThere are alcoholics who have been without any consciousness of God all\ntheir lives; there are some who are actual haters of the idea of a Supreme Be-\ning; there are others, like myself, who have never given up a belief in\nTHE EUROPEAN DRINKER 213\nthe Almighty, but who have always felt that God is far off. And that’s the way\nI felt. I had a closer sense of God during the mass at church, a feeling of His\npresence, but in everyday life He seemed to be at a distance from me and more\nas a righteous judge, than an all-wise, pitying Father to the human race.\nThen occurred the event that saved me. An alcoholic came to see me who is\na doctor. He didn’t talk like a preacher at all. In fact his language was perfectly\nsuited to my understanding. He had no desire to know anything except whether\nI was definite about my desire to quit drinking. I told him with all the sincerity\nat my command that I did. Even then he went into no great detail about how he\nand a crowd of alcoholics, with whom he associated, had mastered their diffi-\nculty. Instead he told me that some of them wanted to talk to me and would be\nover to see me.\nThis doctor had imparted his knowledge to just a few other men at that time—\nnot more than four or five—they now number more than seventy persons. And,\nbecause as I have discovered since, it is part of the ”treatment“ that these men\nbe sent to see and talk with alcoholics who want to quit, he kept them busy. He\nhad already imbued them with his own spirit until they were ready and willing\nat all times to go where sent, and as a doctor he well knew that this mission and\nduty would strengthen them as it later helped me. The visits from these men\nimpressed me at once. Where preaching and prayers had touched me very lit-\ntle, I was immediately impressed with desire for further knowledge of these\nmen.\n214 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\n”There must be something to it,“ I said to myself. ”Why would these busy\nmen take the time to come to see me? They understand my problem. Like me,\nthey’ve tried this remedy and that remedy but never found one that worked.\nBut whatever it is they are using now, it seems to keep them sober.“\nCertainly I could see they were sober. The third man who came to see me\nhad been one of the greatest business-getters his company had ever employed.\nFrom the top of the heap in a few years he had skidded to becoming a shuffling\ncustomer, still entering the better barrooms but welcomed by neither mine host\nnor his patrons. His own business was practically gone, he told me, when he\ndiscovered the answer.\n”You’ve been trying man’s ways and they always fail,“ he told me. ”You\ncan’t win unless you try God’s way.“\n100",

I knew somehow that it meant more than just going to church and living\na moral life. If that was all, then I was a little doubtful that it was the answer I\nwas looking for.\nHe went on talking and told me that he had found the plan has a basis of love\nand the practice of Christ’s\nTHE EUROPEAN DRINKER 215\ninjunction, ”Love thy neighbor as thyself.“ Taking that as a foundation, he\nreasoned that if a man followed that rule he could not be selfish. I could see\nthat. And he further said that God could not accept me as a sincere follower of\nHis Divine Law unless I was ready to be thoroughly honest about it.\nThat was perfectly logical. My church taught that. I had always known that\nin theory. We talked, too, about personal morals. Every man has his problem of\nthis kind but we didn’t discuss it very much. My visitor well knew, that as I\ntried to follow God I would get to studying these things out for myself.\nWe talked things over a long time. I saw readily that I couldn’t afford to\nquibble.

But I have never\nthought of that as something to do and then forget about. I very early came to\nsee that there had to be a continual renewal of that simple deal with God; that\nI had perpetually to keep the bargain. So I began to pray; to place my problems\nin God’s hands.\nFor a long time I kept on trying, in a pretty dumb way at first, I know, but\nvery earnestly. I didn’t want to be a fake. And I began putting in practice what\nI was learning every day. It wasn’t very long until my doctor friend sent me to\ntell another alcoholic what my experience had been.

The first few months were hard. Many\nthings happened; business trials, little worries, and feelings of general despond-\nency came near driving me to the bottle, but I made progress.

Searching where I have been at fault, it is not hard to dis-\ncover and get right again, for I have proven to myself and to many others who\nknow me that God can keep a man sober if he will let Him.\nBeing a Catholic, it is natural that I should attend my own church which I do\nregularly.

It\nled through the mazes and perplexities of an unhappy marriage and divorce,\nand a dark time of separation from my grown children, and a readjustment of\nlife at an age when most women feel pretty sure of a home and security.\nBut I have reached the source of help. I have learned to recognize and ac-\nknowledge the underlying cause of my disease; selfishness, self-pity and re-\nsentment. A few short months ago those three words applied to me would have\naroused as much indignation in my heart as the word alcoholic. The ability to\naccept them as my own has been derived from trying, with the un-ending help\nof God, to live with certain goals in mind.\nComing to the grim fact of alcoholism, I wish I could present the awful reality\nof its insidiousness in such a way that no one could ever again fail to recognize\nthe comfortable, easy steps that lead down to the edge of the precipice, and show\nhow those steps suddenly disappeared when the great gulf yawned before me.

    "text": "There, her husband told me the secret of his rebirth. It is not really a secret at\nall, but something free and open to all of us. He asked me if I believed in God\nor some power greater than myself. Well, I did believe in God, but at that time\nI hadn’t any idea what He is. As a child I had been taught my ”Now I lay me’s“\nand ”Our Father which art in Heaven.“ I had been sent to Sunday School and\ntaken to church. I had been baptized and confirmed. I had been taught to real-\nize there is a God and to ”love“ him. But though I had been taught all these\nthings, I had never learned them.\nWhen B—— (L’s husband) began to talk about God, I felt pretty low in my\nmind. I thought God was something that I, and lots of other people like me,\nhad to worry along without. Yet I had always had the ”prayer habit.“ In fact I\nused to say in my mind ”Now, if God answers this prayer, I’ll know there is a\nGod.“ It was a great system, only somehow it didn’t seem to work!\nFinally B—— put it to me this way: ”You admit you’ve made a mess of\nthings trying to run them your way, are you willing to give up? Are you willing\nto say: ”Here it is God, all mixed up. I don’t know how to un-mix it, I’ll leave\nit to you.“ Well, I couldn’t quite do that. I wasn’t feeling very well, and I was\n222 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nafraid that later when the fog wore off, I’d want to back out. So we let it rest a\nfew days. L and B sent me to stay with some friends of theirs out of town—I’d\nnever seen them before. The man of that house, P—— had given up drinking\nthree months before. After I had been there a few days, I saw that P—— and\nhis wife had something that made them mighty hopeful and happy. But I got a\nlittle uneasy going into a perfect stranger’s home and staying day after day. I\nsaid this to P——and his reply was: ”Why, you don’t know how much it is\nhelping me to have you here.“ Was that a surprise! Always before that when I\nwas recovering from a tailspin I’d been just a pain in the neck to everyone. So, I\nbegan to sense in a small way just what these spiritual principles were all about.\nFinally I very self-consciously and briefly asked God to show me how to do\nwhat He wanted me to do. My prayer was just about as weak and helpless a\nthing as one could imagine, but it taught me how to open my mouth and pray\nearnestly and sincerely. However, I had not quite made the grade. I was full of\nfears, shames, and other ”bug-a-boos“ and two weeks later an incident oc-\ncurred that put me on the toboggan again. I seemed to feel that the hurt of that\nincident was too great to endure without some ”release.“ So I forsook Spirit in\nfavor of ”spirits“ and that evening I was well on the way to a long session with\nmy old enemy ”liquor.“ I begged the person in whose home I was living not to\nlet anyone know, but she, having good sense, got in touch right away with\nthose who had\nA FEMININE VICTORY 223\nhelped me before and very shortly they had rallied round.\nI was eased out of the mess and in a day or two I had a long talk with one of\nthe crowd. I dragged out all my sins of commission and omission, I told every-\nthing I could think of that might be the cause of creating a fear situation, a\nremorse situation, or a shame situation. It was pretty terrible, I thought then, to\nlay myself bare that way, but I know now that such is the first step away from\nthe edge of the precipice.\nThings went very well for quite a while, then came a dull rainy day. I was\nalone. The weather and my self-pity began to cook up a nice dish of the blues\n104",

There was liquor in the house and I found myself suggesting to myself\n”Just one drink will make me feel so much more cheerful.“ Well, I got the\nBible and ”Victorious Living“ and sitting down in full view of the bottle of\nwhiskey, I commenced to read. I also prayed. But I didn’t say ”I must not take\nthat drink because I owe it to so and so not to.“ I didn’t say ”I won’t take that\ndrink because I’m strong enough to resist temptation.“ I didn’t say ”I must\nnot“ or ”I will not“ at all. I simply prayed and read and in half an hour I got up\nand was absolutely free of the urge for a drink.\nIt might be very grand to be able to say ”Finis“ right here, but I see now I\nhadn’t gone all the way I was intended to go.

Gradually, however, God began to clear my channels so\nthat real understanding began to come. Then was the time when full realiza-\ntion and acknowledgement came to me. It was realization and acknowledge-\nment of the fact that I was full of self-pity and resentment, realization of the\nfact that I had not fully given my problems to God. I was still trying to do my\nown fixing.\nThat was more than a year ago. Since then, although circumstances are no\ndifferent, for there are still trials and hardships and hurts and disappointments\nand disillusionments, self-pity and resentment are being eliminated. In this\npast year I haven’t been tempted once. I have no more idea of taking a drink to\naid me through a difficult period than I would if I had never drank.

Such an envi-\nronment would surely do the trick, would surely teach me to drink moderately\nwith the best of them and keep me away from those long, disastrous sprees. I\nwas still young, I could make the grade, and this was my chance to do it.

Thousands of other fellows like him, who have been my\ndrinking companions from time to time, were in no way responsible for the\nway I drank, or what I did, or the way liquor affected me.\nSo off we went, Red and I, to do the town—and do it we did.\nAfter a few drinks we decided there wasn’t much else to do in town except to\nmake a round of the ”cantinas,“ have a good time, get back to the ship early\nand get a good night’s rest. So what harm would a little drinking do now, I\nreasoned. Especially with one full day and two nights ahead to get over it.\nWe visited every ”cantina“ along the straggling main street of La Guayra,\nand feeling high, wide and handsome, Red and I decided to return to the ship.\nWhen we rolled down to the dock we found that our ship had been berthed off\nfrom the wharf about thirty feet and that it was necessary to take a tender out to\nher. No such ordinary method would satisfy Red and myself, so we decided to\nclimb the stern hawser hand over hand to get on board. The flip of a coin\ndecided that I would go first; so off I started, hand over hand, up the hawser.\nNow even a good experienced sailor, perfectly sober, would never attempt\nsuch a foolhardy feat and, as was\n244 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nto be expected, about half way up the hawser I slipped and fell into the bay\nwith a loud splash. I remember nothing more until next morning. The captain\nof the boat said to me ”Young man, it is true that God looks after drunken fools\nand little children. You probably don’t know it, but this bay is infested with\nman-eating sharks and usually a man overboard is a goner. How close you\nwere to death, you don’t realize, but I do.“\nYes, I was lucky to be saved! But it wasn’t until ten years later, after I had\ntime and time again tempted Fate by going on protracted benders that I was\nreally saved—not until after I had been fired from job after job, tried the pa-\ntience of my family to the breaking point, alienated what might have been\nmany, many good, lasting friendships, taken my dear wife through more sor-\nrow and heartaches than any one woman should bear in a lifetime; after doc-\ntors, hospitals, psychiatrists, rest cures, changes of scenery and all the other\n113",

This, of course, was entirely my\nown choice. Drinking by a soldier during those times was viewed with a de-\ngree of indulgence by both superiors and civilians. It seems to me, as I recall it\nnow, that even then I wasn’t satisfied to drink like the normal fellow.\nMost of the United States Army of Occupation were sent back home in 1921\nbut my appetite for travel had been whetted, and having heard terrible stories\nof Prohibition in the United States, I wanted to remain in Europe where ”a man\ncould raise a thirst.“\nSubsequently I went to Russia, then to England, and back to Germany; work-\ning in various capacities, my drinking increasing and my drunken escapades\ngetting worse.

As he talked I gathered\nvaguely, (because he was a faltering beginner then just as I am now) that to be\nrelieved of alcoholism I would have to be different.\nSome days later, after he had been discharged, a stranger came into my shop\nin the nearby town. He introduced himself and began to tell me about a bunch\nof some 60 former drinkers and drunkards who met once a week, and he in-\nvited me to go with him to the next meeting. I thanked him, pleaded business\nengagements and promised I’d go with him at some future date.\n”Anyhow, I’m on the wagon now,“ I said. ”I’m doing a job I like and it’s\nquiet where I live, practically no temptations. I don’t feel bothered about\nliquor.“\nHe looked at me quizzically. He knew too well that\n262 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\ndidn’t mean a thing just as I knew in my heart that it would be only a question\nof time—a few days, a week, or even a month, it was inevitable—till I would\nbe off on another bender.

An accident while drunk laid me low for about three weeks. As soon as\nI could get up and walk I started to drink again and kept it up until my friend of\nthe hospital, who, in his first try at the new way of life had stubbed his toe in\nChicago but had come back to the town to take counsel and make a new start,\npicked me up and got me into a hospital.\nI had been drinking heavily from one state of semi-coma to another and it\nwas several days before I got ”defogged“ but subconsciously I was in earnest\nabout wanting to quit liquor forever. It was no momentary emotionalism born\nof self-pity in a maudlin condition. I was seeking something and I was ready to\nlearn.

My two companions were already sit-\nting up and talking. The day wore on. We passed through small towns. Soon\nthe train was threading its way between factories and huge warehouses, cross-\ning tracks with brisk clatter, coming into a large railway yard. Brakes went on.\nThey helped me off.

They made it very\nplain that I had to seek God, that I had to state my case to Him and ask\nTHE SALESMAN 323\nfor help. Prayer was something I had long forgotten.

When I learned to\ndance I had to go dancing every night in the week if possible; when I worked\nor studied I wanted no interruptions or distractions. Wherever I worked I wanted\nto be the highest paid man in the place or I was irritated; and of course when I\ndrank I could never seem to stop until I was saturated. I was usually hard to get\nalong with as a boy; if the others wouldn’t play my way I’d go home.\nThe town we lived in when I was a child was rather new and raw, peopled\nlargely by immigrants who seemed to be constantly getting married with free\ndrinks and eats for anybody who cared to come. We kids usually managed to\nget to these celebrations, and although supposed to have soda pop we could get\nourselves one or two beers. With this sort of background and more money than\nwas good for me, it was fairly easy to start getting drunk before I was sixteen.\nAfter I left home I earned rather decent salaries but was never satisfied with\nmy position, salary, or the treatment accorded me by my employer. I very sel-\ndom stayed on one job for more than six months until I was married at the age\nof 28, at which time I had already begun to lose jobs because of my drinking.\nWhenever things went wrong I knew that a few drinks would make everything\nrosy, my fears, doubts and worries\n326 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nwould vanish and I would always promise myself that the next time I would stop\nshort of getting plastered.

I was all set, sober, working in a congenial atmosphere for\na firm that had more profitable business than they knew what to do with. I\nmade some beautiful plans. I could save enough in a few years to complete my\nformal education and there were no saloons in the town to trip me up. So what?\nSo at the end of the week I was drunk again for no particular reason at all that\nI could understand. In about three months I was out of a job again, but in the\nmeantime two things of major importance had happened. I had fallen in love\nand war had been declared.\nI had learned my lesson. I knew definitely that I couldn’t take even one\ndrink. I wanted to get married so I planned very earnestly to get another job,\nstay sober, and save some money. I went to Pittsburgh on Sunday, called on\na manufacturer of rolling-mill equipment and on Monday, got a position and\nwent to work. I was first paid at the end of the second week, was drunk\nbefore the end of the day and couldn’t be bothered with going to work the\nnext Monday.\nWhy did I take that first drink? I honestly don’t know.\nAnyhow I nearly went crazy that summer and really developed some sort of\nmental disturbance. The night clerk of the small hotel where I was staying saw\nme go out about three in the morning in pajamas and slippers and had a police-\nman take me back into my room. I suppose he was used to screwy drunks or he\nwould have taken me to jail instead. I stayed there a\n328 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nfew days and sweated the alcohol out of my system, went to the office to col-\nlect the balance of my salary, paid my room rent, and found I had just enough\nmoney to get home. So home I went, sick, broke, discouraged and despairing\nof ever attaining a normal, happy life.\nAfter two or three weeks of idleness at home, I obtained a subordinate posi-\ntion with a former employer, doing the lowest grade of drafting work on an\nhourly basis. I kept reasonably sober for several months, went to see my fian-\ncee one or two weekends, was advanced rapidly in salary and responsibility,\nhad a date set for the wedding and then inadvertently learned that one of the\nmen working under my direction was receiving about forty dollars more per\nmonth than I was, which burnt me up to such an extent I quit after an argu-\nment, took my money, packed my personal effects, left them at the corner drug\nstore, and went downtown and got plastered. Knowing that I would be greeted\nwith tears, sorrowful sympathy and more grief when I got home, I stayed away\nuntil I was again destitute.\nI was really worried sick about my drinking so father again advanced the\nmoney for treatment. This time I took a threeday cure and left with the firm\nresolve never to drink again, got a better position then I’d had before and actu-\nally did keep sober for several months, saved some money, paid my debts and\nagain made plans to get married.

The wedding was again postponed and it looked very much\nas though it would never take place. My employer did not turn me loose but I\nwas in another nice jam nevertheless. After considerable fumbling around\nmentally as to what to do I went back to the threeday cure for the second time.\nAfter this treatment I got along a little better, was married in the spring of\n1919 and did very little drinking for several years. I got along very well with\nmy work, had a happy home life, but when away from home with little likeli-\nhood of being caught at it, I’d go on a mild binge. The thought of what would\nhappen if my wife caught me drinking served to keep me reasonably straight\nfor several years. My work became increasingly more important. I had many\noutside interests and drinking became less of a factor in my life, but I did\ncontinue to tipple some during my outof-town trips and it was because of this\ntendency that things finally became all snarled up at home.\nI was sent to New York on business and later stopped at a night club where I\nhad been drunk before. I certainly must have been very tight and it is quite\nlikely that I was ”Mickey Finned“ for I woke up about noon the next day in my\nhotel without a cent. I had to borrow money to get home on but didn’t bother to\nstart back till several days later. When I got there I found a sick child, a dis-\ntracted wife and had lost another job paying $7,000 a year. This, however, was\nnot the worst of it. I must have given my business card to one of the girls\n330 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nat the night club for she started to send me announcements of another clip-\njoint where she was employed and writing me long hand ”come on“ notes, one\nof which fell into my wife’s hands. I’ll leave what happened after that to the\nreader’s imagination.\nI went back into the business of getting and losing jobs and eventually got to\nthe point where I didn’t seem to have any sense of responsibility to myself or\nto my family. I’d miss important family anniversaries, forget to come home for\nChristmas and in general wouldn’t go home until I was exhausted physically\nand flat broke. About four years ago I didn’t come home on Christmas Eve but\narrived there about six o’clock on Christmas morning, minus the tree I had\npromised to get, but with an enormous package of liquor on board. I took the\nthree-day cure again with the usual results but about three weeks later I went\nto a party and decided a few beers wouldn’t hurt me; however I didn’t get back\nto work for three days and a short while later had lost my job and was again at\nthe bottom of things. My wife obtained employment on a relief basis and I\nfinally got straightened out with my employer who placed me in another posi-\ntion in a nearby city which I also lost by the end of the year.\nSo it went until about a year ago when a neighbor happened to hear me\ntrying to get into the house and asked my wife whether I had been having some\ndrinking difficulties. This, of course, disturbed my wife but our neighbor was\nnot just inquisitive. She had heard of the work of an ex-alcoholic doctor who\nwas busily engaged in passing on the benefits he had received from another\nFIRED AGAIN 331\nwho had found the answer to his difficulties with liquor. As a result of this my\nwife saw the doctor. Then I talked with him, spent a few days in a local hospi-\ntal and haven’t had a drink since.\n152",

I became convinced\nthen and there that if these men had learned something that could keep them\nsober, I also could profit from the same knowledge. Before leaving the hospi-\ntal, two of these men, convinced of my sincerity of purpose, imparted to me\nthe necessary knowledge and mental tools which have resulted in my complete\nsobriety for thirteen months, and an assurance that I need never, so long as I\nlive, drink anything of an alcoholic nature if I kept on the right track.\nMy health is better, I enjoy a fellowship which gives me a happier life than I\nhave ever known, and my family joins me in a daily expression of gratitude.\n332\nTHE FEARFUL ONE\nWHEN I was 21, I was taken suddenly and violently ill and was ill for seven\nyears. As a result of this illness I was left with a poorish nervous system and a\ncurious phobia. As this has a large place in my story, I will try to explain it\nclearly. After I had been ill some months, I grew strong enough to get out of\ndoors a little each day, but found I couldn’t get farther than the nearest corner\nwithout becoming totally panic stricken. As soon as I turned back home the\npanic would vanish. I gradually overcame this particular phase of the trouble\nby setting myself longer distances to walk each day. Similarly I learned later to\ntake short street car rides, then longer ones, and so forth, until I appeared to be\ndoing most of the things other people do daily. But the things I did not have to\ndo each day, or at least frequently, remained unconquered and a source of great\nbut secret embarrassment to me.\nSo I went on for years, planning always to sidestep the things I was afraid of,\nbut concealing my fear from everyone. Those years of illness were not all total\ninvalidism. I made a good living part of the time, but was continually falling\ndown and having to get up and start over again. The whole process gave me a\nlicked feeling, especially when, towards the end of my twenties, I had to give\nup the presidency of a small company which was just turning the corner to real\nsuccess.\nTHE FEARFUL ONE 333\nShortly after this, I was successfully operated on and became a physically\nwell man. But the surgeon did not remove the phobia, that remained with me.\nDuring the period of my illness I was not especially interested in liquor. I\nwas not a teetotaler, but I was just a ”social drinker.“ However, when I was\nabout thirty, my mother died. I went to pieces as I had become very dependent\non my parents through my illness. When I began to get on my feet again I\ndiscovered that whiskey was a fine relief from the terrific nervous headaches I\nhad developed. Long after the headaches were gone, however, I kept discovering\nother difficulties for which whiskey was a grand cure. During the ensuing ten\nyears I once, by sheer will power, remained dry for five weeks.\nI had many business opportunities during those ten years which, although I\ntried to keep them in my grasp, slipped through my fingers. A lovely wife\ncame and went. She tried her best and our baby’s birth put me on my mettle for\nall of six months, but after that, worse and more of it.

He told me why I failed.\nHe then suggested that I accompany him to a local doctor who had been\nhelpful to him. It took forty-eight hours of persuasion and quite a few drinks to\nfortify myself, but I finally agreed to go. The doctor turned out to be one who\nhad been an alcoholic himself, and in gratitude for the release he had found\nand because he understood the true meaning of the phrase ”Brotherly Love“\nwas spending a great portion of his time helping unfortunate individuals like\nmyself.\nWith the help and advice of these two individuals and two or three associ-\nates, I was able, for the first time in two and a half years, to stay sober for six\nweeks, and then disastrously tried the beer experiment.

Now, a very nice woman, Miss J. who was office clerk and\npianist for the boss, overheard the conversation and told both Mr. X and Miss\nZ that I would not be interested.\nOn hearing this I went out and drank enough to cause plenty of trouble,\nslapping Miss J. and doing an all round drunk act in the studio.\nThis was the end of my high-flying among the white lights.

Finally I worked up quite a business and opened a store, then\ntwo stores, with eleven people working for me.\nNow here is where Old Barleycorn showed his hidden strength.\nI found that in order to have a paying business I had to make friends, not the\nkind I was used to, but ordinary, sane, hard working people.

The\ninstant I would come out a free man I would go right back to old Alky again. In\nthis one thing I found out later I was perfectly right.\nWhat I thought and wanted at the time was ”not to want, to want to take a\ndrink.“ This phrase is a very important link in my story.

My reputation for drinking soon became more or less generally known.\nAbout this time a deacon and the pastor of one of the local churches used to\ncome in the shop for their work and were constantly inviting me to church and\nBible classes, which invitations irritated me very much. I earnestly wished\nthey would mind their own business.\nI finally did accept one or two invitations to social functions at the home of\none of these men, and was received so cordially that the barrier between us\nwas partially lowered.\nI did not stop drinking however, though my feeling toward these men was\nkindly. They at last persuaded me to go to a nearby town to have a talk with a\ndoctor who had had a great deal of experience with this type of trouble. I\nlistened to the man for two hours, and although my mind was quite foggy, I\nretained a good deal of what he said. I feel that the combined effort of these\nthree Christian gentlemen made it possible for me to have a vital spiritual\nexperience. This occurred in March, 1937.\nFor about six years previous to this time I was never at any time completely\nfree from the influence of liquor.\nSince that time I have regained the love of my family and the respect of the\ncommunity, and can truthfully say that the past two years have been the happi-\nest of my life.\nI have busied myself a great deal during these two years in helping others\nwho were afflicted as I was, and\n350 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nthe combined efforts of the deacon, the pastor, and myself, have resulted in\nnine other men finding a way out of difficulties which were identical with\nmine.

I had read rather extensively, but when people began to talk in such\nultimates I was lost. I could find in life no eternal purpose nor anything that\nmight be labeled ”divine guidance.“ War, illness, cruelty, stupidity, poverty\nand greed were not and could not be the product of any purposeful creation.\nThe whole thing simply didn’t make sense.\nAbout this I felt no deep emotion. I had struggled with the problem during\nlate adolescence, but had long since ceased to give it anxious thought. Many\npeople believe in a god of some sort and worship him in various ways. That\nwas excellent. I thought it nice that so many people, poor misguided souls,\ncould find so simple a solution to their problems. If this world proved too\nhopelessly disillusioning they could always seek comfort in a more pleasant\nexistence promised in a world to come, where wrongs would be righted and\njustice tempered with tender mercy would prevail. But none of that was for\nme. I had enough courage and intellectual honesty to face life as I saw it with-\nout recourse to a self-erected deity.\nThe next day another man visited me.

He had been in the same position, yet he hadn’t had\na drink in over three years! He told me of other men who had found sobriety\nthrough the recognition of some power beyond themselves. If I cared to I was\nto consider myself invited to a gathering\nEDUCATED AGNOSTIC 353\nthe following Tuesday where I would meet other alcoholics who had stopped.\nWith the knowledge I now have, it is hard for me to recall how screwy the\nwhole thing sounded—the blind leading the blind, a union of drunks, all banded\ntogether in some kind of a spiritual belief! What could be more idiotic! But . .\n. these men were sober! Nuts!\nI returned to my despairing wife with this incoherent story of a bunch of\ndrunks who had found a cure for their alcoholism through some kind of spir-\nitual exercise and who held regular meetings where, as far as I could figure\nout, they went through some kind of spiritual exercise! She was very nearly\nconvinced that my mental balance had now been completely and probably per-\nmanently destroyed. The only rational support I could find for giving it a try\nwas that it was vouched for by the kindly doctor whom she had met on several\noccasions at the hospital. That and the fact that nothing else worked.\nMay I stop at this point and address a few sentences direct to agnostic or\natheistically inclined alcoholics: You can’t take less stock in the references\nmade to God in this book than I would have if this book had been available to\nme at that time. To you those references have no meaning. They have simply\nused a name that people give to a fond delusion.

I know that I have\nnever before been so inspired. It was not anything that happened. Because\nnothing happened. Nor yet by anything that was said, but more by an atmos-\nphere created by friendliness, sincerity, honesty, confidence, and good cheer. I\ncouldn’t\nEDUCATED AGNOSTIC 355\nbelieve that these men could have been drunks, and yet gradually I learned\ntheir stories, alcoholics every one!\nThat was, with me, the beginning of a new life. It would be difficult, if not\nimpossible, for me to put into words the change that has taken place in me, I\nhave since learned that with many members the change has been almost in-\nstantaneous. This was not the case with me. I was tremendously inspired at\nfirst, but my basic thinking was not altered that evening nor did I expect any\nprofound change. I felt that while the spiritual aspect of what these men had\nwas not for me, I did believe strongly in the emphasis they put on the need to\nhelp others. I felt that if I could have the inspiration of these gatherings and if\nI could have an opportunity to try to help others that the two together would re-\nenforce my own will-power and thus be of tremendous assistance. But gradu-\nally, in a manner I can not explain, I began to reexamine the beliefs I had\nthought beyond criticism. Almost imperceptibly my whole attitude toward life\nunderwent a silent revolution. I lost many worries and gained confidence. I\nfound myself saying and thinking things that a short time ago I would have\ncondemned as platitudes! A belief in the basic spirituality of life has grown\nand with it belief in a supreme and guiding power for good.\nIn the process of this change I can recognize two immensely significant steps\nfor me. The first step I took when I admitted to myself for the first time that all\nmy previous thinking might be wrong. The second step came when I first con-\nsciously wished to believe. As a\n356 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nresult of this experience I am convinced that to seek is to find, to ask is to be\ngiven.

It\nis only when a man has tried everything else, when in utter desperation and\nterrific need he turns to something bigger than himself, that he gets a glimpse\nof the way out. It is then that contempt is replaced by hope, and hope by\nfulfillment.\nIn this personal story I have endeavored to relate something of my experi-\nence in the search for spiritual help rather than a description of the neurotic\ndrinking that made the search necessary. After all, the pattern of most alco-\nholic experiences fits a pretty general mold. Experiences differ because of cir-\ncumstances, environment, and temperament, but the after effects, both physi-\ncal and mental, are almost identical. It makes but little difference how or why\na man becomes an alcoholic once this disease manifests itself. The preventive\nmeasures adopted for alcoholic tendencies in the future will have to be found\nin a more progressive program of mental hygiene and medical research than is\nnow obtainable.\nAN ARTIST’S CONCEPT 381\nIt is important that at present we believe there is only one sure pathway to\nrecovery for any alcoholic.\nIn my own case I was not entirely ignorant of the causes that led me into\nexcessive drinking.

It led me in the end, however, to the fact that for me here was a\nmental and physical disease that science had placed in the category of\n”incurables.“ Briefly, all that this study and research ever did for me was to\nshow something about WHY I drank. It substantiated a fact I had known all\nalong, that my drinking was symptomatic. It did point out a road to better\nmental health but it demanded something of me in return that I did not have to\ngive. It asked of me a power of self-will but it did not take into consideration\nthat this self-will was already drugged with poison—that it was very sick. In-\ntuitively I also knew that a person constrained to temperance by the domina-\ntion of will is no more ”cured“ of his vice than if he were locked up in prison.\nI knew that somehow, some way, the mental stream, the emotions, must be\npurified before the right pathway could be followed.\nIt was about this time that I began ”flirting“ with religion as a possible way\nout. I approached the subject in a wary, none too reverent, attitude. I believed\nin an omnipotent God or Deity, but the orthodox approach through the church,\nwith its dogma and ritual,\n382 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nleft me unmoved. The more I struggled to gain an intelligent grasp upon spir-\nitual development, the more confused I became. On the other hand a purely\nmaterialistic viewpoint that postulated a ”mechanical order of things“ seemed\ntoo negative even to entertain. As an artist I had spent too much time commun-\ning with nature—trying to place upon canvas or paper my emotional feelings,\nnot to know that a tremendous spiritual power was back of the universe. There\nwas, however, so much that seemed illogical or sentimental about religion in\ngeneral—so many doubts assailed me, so many problems to be confronted—\nyet there was within myself a strong and urgent desire for spiritual satisfac-\ntion. The occasional periods in which I felt a spiritual emotion, I immediately\nexamined with all the ardor of the inveterate analyst. Was this emotion just a\nform of religious ecstasy? Was it fear? Was it just blind belief or had I tapped\nsomething?\n”Most men,“ wrote Thoreau, ”lead lives of quiet desperation.“ It was the\narticulation of this despair that led to my drinking in the beginning. Religion,\nso far, had only added to my desperation. I drank more than ever.\nA seed had been planted, however, and a short time afterward I met the man\nwho has for the past five years devoted a great deal of time and energy to\nhelping alcoholics. Looking back on that meeting, the simplicity of his talk\nwith me is amazing. He told me very little but what I already knew, in part, but\nwhat he did have to say was bereft of all fancy spiritual phraseology—it was\nsimple Christianity imparted with Divine Power. The\nAN ARTIST’S CONCEPT 383\nnext day I met over twenty men who had achieved a mental rebirth from alco-\nholism. Here again it was not so much what these men told me in regard to\ntheir experiences that was impressive, as it was a sense or feeling that an invis-\nible influence was at work. What was it this man had and these other men\nexemplified without their knowing? They were human everyday sort of peo-\nple. They certainly were not pious.

Here was spiritual\nlaw working through human lives just as definitely and with the same phenom-\nena expressed in the physical laws that govern the material world.\nThese men were like lamps supplied with current from a huge spiritual dy-\nnamo and controlled by the rheostat of their souls. They burned dim, bright, or\nbrilliant, depending upon the degree and progress of their contact. And this\ncontact could only be maintained just so long as they obeyed that spiritual law.\nThese men were thinking straight—therefore their actions corresponded to\ntheir thoughts. They had given\n384 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nthemselves, their minds, over to a higher power for direction. Here, it seemed\nto me, in the one word ”Thought“-was the crux of the whole spiritual quest.\nThat ”As a man thinketh in his heart, so is he“ and so is his health, his environ-\nment, his failure, or his success in life.\nHow foolish I had been in my quest for spiritual help. How selfish and ego-\ntistical I had been to think that I could approach God intellectually. In the very\nstruggle to obtain faith I had lost it. I had given to the term faith a religious\nsignificance only. I had failed to see that faith was ”our common everyday\nmanner of thinking.“ That good and evil were but end results of certain uni-\nform and reliable spiritual laws. Obviously, my own thinking had been decid-\nedly wrong. Normal most of the time, it was abnormal at the wrong times.\nLike everyone’s thinking, it was a mixture of good and bad, but mainly it was\nuncontrolled.\nI had been sticking my chin out and getting socked by spiritual law until I\nwas punch drunk. If one could become humble, if he could become ”as a little\nchild“ before this powerful spiritual thought force, the pathway could be dis-\ncovered.\nThe day I made my first efforts in this direction an entire new world opened\nup for me. Drinking as a vicious habit was washed completely out of my con-\nsciousness. I have never even been tempted to take a drink since. As a matter of\nfact there are so many other things within myself that need correction that the\ndrink habit looks silly in comparison. Please do not assume that all this is but\nan exposition of spiritual pride. A\nAN ARTIST’S CONCEPT 385\nchart of my spiritual progress would look like the ”graph“ of a business that\nhad been hit by everything but an earthquake. But there has been progress. It\nhas cured me of a vicious habit. Where my life had been full of mental turmoil\nthere is now an ever increasing depth of calmness. Where there was a hit or\nmiss attitude toward living there is now new direction and force.\nThe approaches of man to God are many and varied. My conception of God\nas Universal Mind is after all but one man’s approach to and concept of the\nSupreme Being. To me it makes sense, opens up a fascinating field of endeavor\nand is a challenge, the acceptance of which can make of life the ”Adventure\nMagnificent.“\n176",

Anything in reference to\nthis subject was worthy of perusal, for her son, an only child, had been drinking\nuncontrollably for years. Each year of his drinking had added new heart-\naches, though every small ray of hope had been investigated, and though he\nhad tried desperately to stop. But little had been accomplished. He was occa-\nsionally able to remain sober for short periods at a time, but things con-\nstantly became worse.\nSo this mother read the short medical article with a heavy heart, for she was\nconstantly on the alert to find something which might prove helpful to her son.\nThe article gave only a vague hint of the solution found by many alcoholics,\nwhich is fully covered in this book, but the mother immediately wrote to the\ndoctor explaining her heart-breaking problem, and requesting further informa-\ntion. She felt there must be help somewhere, and surely if other men had re-\ncovered from alcoholism, her son also had a chance.\nThe doctor turned her letter over to Alcoholics Anonymous. It ended as fol-\nlows:\n”God knows if you can help my son, it will bring happiness to many of us\nwho love him and ache with him in his futile effort to overcome his problem.\n392 ALCOHOLICS ANONYMOUS\nPlease accept my gratitude for whatever you may be able to do and let me\nhear from you.“\nA few days later the following letter was sent to this mother.

We are now preparing a book hoping to help others who\nsuffer in the same way, and are enclosing a rough copy of the first two chap-\nters.

Once out, I wrecked my car, driving\nwhile intoxicated, and it seemed that I might get a stiff jail sentence so when it\nwas suggested that I might avoid that by going back to the asylum, I accepted.\nThe bughouse had no terrors for me. I knew I could always get a supply of\nliquor and stay half stupefied most of the time. In the institution I became a\nnuisance to officials, attendants, and doctors. I had been in and out of the place\nso often that even the sincere professional medical men and psychologists had\ngiven me up. Suggestion, kindness, everything had been tried.

This time I was treated like any insane\nperson, was punished for infractions, any breaches of discipline. I could still\nget all the liquor I wanted through my financial reserve and that was all I cared\nabout.\nI used to talk with another inmate about this drinking business. He was a\nman who had lost one good job after another, had fallen from a good profes-\nsional position to the status of a hobo. This fellow knew and had lived in al-\nmost every railroad jungle from coast to coast and had finally been slammed\ninto the bughouse because his family didn’t want to read about his death some-\nday as a friendless wanderer.

If I’ve got to turn around and join a church and sing hymns and\nholler ‘Amen’ when some long-bearded jasper, who spends six days out of\nthe week skinning suckers, legally begins to pray in meeting, I don’t want\nany part of it.“\n”You don’t have to do that,“ he said. ”And, anyway, the long-bearded slicker\nis no concern of yours. Your problem is yourself.“\nMy friend was new to this job of helping the other fellow, but I couldn’t get\naway from the fact that he was now sober and that he had got that way and was\nbeing kept that way by a religious experience. He made me a proposition.\n”I’ll come for you Wednesday night,“ he said. ”I’ll take you to where a bunch\nof guys who used to be pickled practically all the time meet every week. You\ncan see and listen and judge for yourself.“\nWith my friend I attended that meeting. I was cordially received. I knew a\ngood many of them and listened attentively, but I say quite honestly it left me\ncold. Not that it was like a church service. No, it wasn’t like that at all. When\nsome stories had been told it ended up with the Lord’s Prayer, then everybody\nsat around and visited. I was beginning to get a little scared. Now, I thought, is\nwhen they’ll put the works to a guy; along about this time one of these mugs is\ngoing to get me in a corner and ask me about my soul.\nNothing of the sort happened. They invited me back again. Others asked if\nthey could come to see me, when I’d be in and so forth. My pal stuck pretty\nclose to me that week. Some of the gang turned up at my home and told me\nhow they had been helped to quit drinking. I went back to the next meeting and\nthe next and the next again. Gradually I began to see what it was all about. I\nlistened carefully for I was now definitely interested. More or less unconsciously\nI was seeking for something. I didn’t know it then, but I think I was surely\n185",

    "text": "seeking God. Now, I didn’t find God suddenly. You must remember that God\nwas never in any of my plans. The former cynical, gambler-slicker who didn’t\neven believe much that there was honor among thieves, gradually learned that\nLove is the law of God. I, who had strictly followed the injunction that you\nshould never give a sucker an even break, had to learn that God demands we be\nhonest if we are to follow His teachings.\nI am writing this in the Thanksgiving season. It is a great privilege to have\nthe fine human friendship and association of this gang of former drunks. It is\nan even greater privilege when I can be of service in helping some guy to a\nremedy which is his for the taking.\nBut if friends and fellowship were to disappear tomorrow I don’t think I\nwould be dismayed. Back of all that there is the knowledge that I have a Divine\nFather - that as long as I try to walk as He has laid down for me to do through-\nout my life, nothing of ill can befall me, that if I wish I can be sober for the rest\nof my days.\nI have a simple little job on which I make less in a month that I formerly\nmade in a day, but that doesn’t worry me. I know there is something far better\nthan mere dollars. There isn’t a gambling house of note that wouldn’t be glad\nto have me as an operator, for the owners know I’m capable, that I can bring\nand keep business. In fact, some who know, think I would be a greater asset\nthan ever for they have confidence that I would make an honest accounting of\nreceipts.\nNo, I don’t have much money nowadays, but I don’t need any. I am quite\nsure that God doesn’t want me to go back to the green tables and the shaded\nlights again. It might even be possible that I could go back to my former pro-\nfession and stay sober, but I doubt it. Accustomed to coldly calculating the\nodds all my life, I’m of the opinion that they would be definitely against me.\nHis Will must be my bet - There’s no other way!\nPrologue\nEfforts are being made by AA members in the U.S. to distribute books to\nthose alcoholics who cannot afford to buy a big book — for example those\nin the correctional facilities. Here is a paperback book containing a 1st edi-\ntion reprint including the story section. This book is distributed entirely for\nfree and dedicated to newcomers who seek relief from alcoholism.\nThe whole text is in the public domain. AA can claim no proprietary right\nto the recovery program, for our principles, as all spiritual truths, are re-\ngarded as available to all mankind1.\nThe 1st edition was published from 1939 to 1955. During this time, the\nrecovery rates were highest. Should a 4th edition better reflect the fellow-\nship of today, or should the fellowship of today better reflect our good old\nbook?

    "text": "tion, 50% got sober immediately and remained that way; more than 25%\nsobered up after some relapses2. We’d love to repeat those marvelous re-\nsults. The stories of the 1st edition tell us how the founders of our Fellow-\nship applied spiritual principles to their lives and escaped alcoholic hell; all\nthe early Akron veterans—a dozen and a half of them—whose stories are\nthe backbone of the 1st edition and who, together with Dr. Bob, had created\nthe first AA group in the world3. The Cleveland pioneers had proved three\nessential things: the value of personal sponsorship; the worth of the A.A.\nbook in indoctrinating newcomers, and finally the tremendous fact that A.A.,\nwhen the word really got around, could now soundly grow to great size4.\nTo show other alcoholics precisely how we have recovered is the main\npurpose of this book. It is given to you by members of AA groups. We are\nnot allied with any particular faith or organization, nor do we oppose any-\none. We simply wish to be helpful to those who are afflicted5.\nThis book was unselfishly written and edited by a team of about 40 people\n60 years ago. It should carry the message to new areas and keep it undiluted\nand unchanged. We will briefly outline the chain of events and historical\nfacts that made us come to believe that we would pass on this low-cost book\nat no charge. We do so, because we are not an organization in the conven-\ntional sense of the word. There are no fees or dues whatsoever6.\nIn a speech delivered in Fort Worth, Texas, in 1954, Bill Wilson reported:\nSo, on this late Fall afternoon in 1937, Smithy and I were talking to-\ngether in his living room, Anne sitting there when we began to count\nnoses. How many people had stayed dry; in Akron, in New York, maybe\na few in Cleveland? How many had stayed dry and for how long?\nAnd when we added up the total, it sure was a handful of, I don’t know,\n35, 40 maybe. But enough time had elapsed on enough really fatal cases\nof alcoholism, so that we grasped the importance of these small statis-\ntics. Bob and I saw for the first time that this thing was going to succeed.\nThat God in His providence and mercy had thrown a new light into the\ndark caves where we and our kind had been and were still dwelling by\nthe millions. I never can forget the elation and ecstasy that seized us\nboth. And then we sat happily talking and reflecting. We reflected that\nwell, a couple of score of drunks were sober but this had taken three long\nyears. There had been an immense amount of failure and a long time\nhad been taken just to sober up the handful. How could this handful carry\nits message to all those who still didn’t know? Not all the drunks in the\nworld could come to Akron or to New York. How could we transmit our\nmessage to them, and by what means?\n... That evening Bob and I told them that we were within sight of suc-\ncess and that we thought this thing might go on and on and on, that a\n2 See also: FOREWORD TO 2nd EDITION, pg.

    "text": "new light indeed was shining in our dark world. But how could this light\nbe a reflection and transmitted without being distorted and garbled? And\nat this point, they turned the meeting over to me, and being a salesman,\nI set right to work on the drunk tanks and subsidies for the missionaries,\nI was pretty poor then. And we touched on the book. The group con-\nscience consisted of 18 men good and true and you could see right away\nthat these 18 good and true men were damned skeptical about it all.\nAlmost with one voice, they chorused “Let’s keep it simple. This is going\nto bring money into this thing. Think, this is going to create a professional\nclass. We’ll all be ruined.”\nThis early opinion during later years crystallized in the conviction that\nnothing could so surely destroy our spirituality as futile disputes over prop-\nerty, money, and authority. We should remain forever non-professional. To\ncarry the message face to face or in print is never to be paid for7.\nIn a letter of April 27th, 1944, Clarence S., founder of the first AA meeting\nin Cleveland (The Home Brewmeister) wrote:\nIt was my understanding at the time the book was published that should\nthere be any profits accrue from the sale of the book, after the stockhold-\ners were paid and the plates etc. cleared, that money was to go to the\nFoundation and we hoped to get out a dollar copy of the book for wide\ndistribution ... in order that no one should have a financial interest in the\nbook and any profits could be used for the furtherance of the “Labor of\nLove”.\nMr. Leonard V. Harrison, Chairman of the Alcoholic Foundation, answered\non official letterhead July 7th, 1944, and on page 4 wrote in response to Clarence:\nMr. Wilson tells me that later on, about 1941, he did talk to you about\nthe desirability of a $1.00 book. He said he thought such a book might be\nprinted from the old plates when the debts were paid and a new edition\ncame out ...\nIn the past, A.A. groups contributed enough to cover about two-thirds of\nthe service expense. The remainder was covered by publishing income, which\nwas in excess of that required for publishing expense. So, in 1986, the Gen-\neral Service Board asked for a special effort to inform the Fellowship of the\ndangers inherent in this situation; particularly that a substantial fraction of\nthe publishing income now comes from outside sources—in violation of our\n7th tradition. The effort was begun to inform the groups about this growing\nproblem. The challenge was to make G.S.O.’s service work self-supporting\nthrough contributions of the membership and to sell literature at cost to eve-\nryone8.\nTo make our service work independent from literature profits is manda-\ntory for ConceptVII9 and ConceptX10. If our service work would rely on\nincome from literature sales rather than solely on our group’s voluntary con-\ntributions, any manger of an AA corporation could say “I don’t care what\n8See also: AA Service Manual, pg.

    "text": "AA groups want. Forget about their two cents, we can do as we please since\nwe get enough money from our literature sales.” Our traditional “power of\nthe A.A. purse”9 would become a bad joke10.\nSome of us said to ourselves: “Let it begin with us!” We can start and do\nthat just for today. For we are now on a different basis — the basis of trust-\ning and relying upon God. We trust infinite God rather than our finite selves.\nWe are in the world to play a role He assigns11.\nSo several years ago a few recovered alcoholics were sitting together and\nfelt deeply touched by these circumstances. They committed themselves to\nspread the word and take action. And many alcoholics from America and\nEurope combined their efforts, offered voluntary work and threw their “two\ncents” into the hat—to express their gratitude for the recovery and freedom\nfrom bondage they found for themselves. Let’s hear their report:\nIn 1997 this process prepaid 75,000 mini editions of the 11 chapters plus\nthe Foreword and The Doctors Opinion plus a two-page U.S.-wide\nIntergroup phone directory. These booklets were badly needed in the Cali-\nfornia correctional system and mostly distributed to inmates by local AA\nmembers and by chaplains inside the walls. Considerable numbers also\nwent to correctional facility committees in the Midwest and to the East\nCoast. One member reported, that inmates were now surprisingly allowed\nby authorities to keep these little books all the time and take them to their\ncells, providing the possibility to read them now and then. Strange but true,\nthe usual regular editions were prohibited and could only be read during\nmeetings or at the library. The corrections officers were afraid that some\nprisoners could misuse the hard-backed books as weapons.\nAlso 5000 Spanish translations of the 1st edition (without the story sec-\ntion) went into the California facilities and another 20,000 went to Mexico.\nRussian alcoholics, having practically no financial resources of their own\nin those currently rough times, gratefully received 50,000 mini editions in\na new and modern language translation, which is—by the way—more\naccurate and thus closer to our original than the previous one, which\nomitted whole paragraphs of the English text. Many of our fellows in Swe-\nden, especially newcomers, could not afford to buy a book for US$44.00,\n9 See also: AA Service Manual, pg. S102 and Concept VII pg 29 “The Charter\nand Bylaws of the General Service Board are legal instruments, empower-\ning the trustees to manage and conduct world service affairs. The Confer-\nence Charter is not a legal document; it relies upon tradition and the A.A.\npurse for final effectiveness.\n10See also: AA Service Manual, Concept X, pg. 44 “For example, if the\ngroups are dissatisfied with the Conference, they can elect better Delegates\nor withhold funds. If the Delegates must, they can censure or reorganize\nthe Trustees. The Trustees can do the same with the service corporations.\nIf a corporation does not approve of the operations of its executives or\nstaff, any or all of them can be fired.”\n11See also: Chapter Five of this book, pg.80 in this edition, pg.68 in the 2nd\nand 3rd edition\n189",

With the help of a German group both countries got a car-\nload of 5000 mini editions each—for free. Meanwhile the textbooks be-\ncame a powerful tool for 12th step work throughout the countryside and\nin prisons and treatment centers as well. 5000 Hebrew mini editions were\nput out.\nThe German Fellowship was presented with close to 30,000 free Ger-\nman mini editions. This became necessary, because three different “offi-\ncial” translations had been published in that country since 1962—all rather\nmore than less stray from our English text. The deviation of the latest\nedition (1983-1996) was so serious, that A.A.W.S. General Manager\nGeorge D. said, when he was made aware of that situation by a delega-\ntion of German members, that came to N.Y. in 1996: “Neither you nor\nanyone else may change anything in the wording of the Steps and Tradi-\ntions. Never! Neither may any word be dropped. It has to be translated as\nclosely as possible to the original.” And he added: “You have to work this\nout within your German service structure! Don’t tell me anything but get\nin contact with them.” German G.S.O. has meanwhile improved the qual-\nity of their German translation and has offered both hardcover and pocket\neditions at a 20% discount since then.\nMost of us feel we need look no further for Utopia. As you see, improve-\nments have become possible. We follow the path suggested by our 1986\nGeneral Service Conference and carry the message, prepaid by 7th tradition\ncontributions, in a strictly non-professional way. Each day some member’s\nsimple talk at our kitchen table multiplies itself in a widening circle of peace\non earth and good will to men12.\nParallel to these astonishing events, ordinary group members, along with\npast and present trusted servants from throughout the U.S. and some other\ncountries including GSRs, DCMs, conference delegates, AA archivists, com-\nmittee chairmen and even one past A.A. General Service Board trustee, at-\ntempted to coordinate those wide-spread activities somewhat, puting them\non more shoulders, on a solid service structure base and went ahead.\nWe have now accumulated some 7th tradition money, that makes it possi-\nble to provide a full 1st edition reprint—including all of the stories. Pretty\ngood stuff! We hope it will serve many newcomers and help them acquire\nlasting sobriety.\nInquiries from individuals, groups, big book study meetings, Intergroups,\nC.S.O.s or committees are welcome. We will be happy to help as much as\npossible.\n12 See also: End of Chapter One, pg. 26 in this edition, pg. 16 in the 2nd and\n3rd edition\n190",
